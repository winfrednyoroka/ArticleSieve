172,A Novel Method for Mendelian Randomization Analyses With Pleiotropy and Linkage Disequilibrium in Genetic Variants From Individual Data,"Mendelian randomization makes use of genetic variants as instrumental variables to eliminate the influence induced by unknown confounders on causal estimation in epidemiology studies. However, with the soaring genetic variants identified in genome-wide association studies, the pleiotropy, and linkage disequilibrium in genetic variants are unavoidable and may produce severe bias in causal inference. In this study, by modeling the pleiotropic effect as a normally distributed random effect, we propose a novel mixed-effects regression model-based method PLDMR, pleiotropy and linkage disequilibrium adaptive Mendelian randomization, which takes linkage disequilibrium into account and also corrects for the pleiotropic effect in causal effect estimation and statistical inference. We conduct voluminous simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed and existing methods. Simulation results illustrate the validity and advantage of the novel method, especially in the case of linkage disequilibrium and directional pleiotropic effects, compared with other methods. In addition, by applying this novel method to the data on Atherosclerosis Risk in Communications Study, we conclude that body mass index has a significant causal effect on and thus might be a potential risk factor of systolic blood pressure. The novel method is implemented in R and the corresponding R code is provided for free download. Copyright ¬© 2021 Wang, Li, Fu, Yang and Hu.",Included,Included
29,"A UGT1A1 variant is associated with serum total bilirubin levels, which are causal for hypertension in African-ancestry individuals","Serum bilirubin is associated with several clinical outcomes, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and drug metabolism. Here, we describe findings from our genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of serum (TBIL) using a generalized linear mixed model in West Africans (n = 1127), with adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, T2D, significant principal components of population structure, and cryptic relatedness. Genome-wide conditional analysis and CAVIARBF were used to fine map significant loci. The causal effect of TBIL on hypertension was assessed by Mendelian randomization (MR) using the GWAS findings as instrumental variables (IVs) in African Americans (n = 3,067). The SNP rs887829 (UGT1A1) was significantly associated with TBIL levels (effect allele (T) frequency = 0.49, beta (SE) = 0.59 (0.04), p = 9.13 x 10-54). Genome-wide conditional analysis and regional fine mapping pointed to rs887829 as a possible causal variant with a posterior inclusion probability of 0.99. The T allele of rs887829 is associated with lower hepatic expression of UGT1A1. Using rs887829 as an IV, two-stage least-squares MR showed a causal effect of bilirubin on hypertension (beta = -0.76, 95% CI [-1.52, -0.01], p = 0.0459). Our finding confirms that UGT1A1 influences bilirubin levels. Notably, lower TBIL is causally associated with the increased risk of hypertension.",Included,Included
75,A data-driven approach for studying the role of body mass in multiple diseases: a phenome-wide registry-based case-control study in the UK Biobank,"BACKGROUND: Mendelian randomisation allows for the testing of causal effects in situations where clinical trials are challenging to do. In this hypothesis-free, data-driven phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), we sought to assess possible associations of high body-mass index (BMI) with multiple disease outcomes., METHODS: For this registry-based case-control PheWAS, we used genome-wide data available from the UK Biobank to construct a genetic risk score of 76 variants related to BMI. Eligible UK Biobank participants were aged 37-73 years during recruitment, were white British, were unrelated to each other, and had available genetic information. Disease outcomes from these participants were mapped to a phenotype code (phecode). Participants with a phecode of interest were recoded as cases, whereas participants without a phecode of interest or any codes under a parent phecode were classified as controls. We did a PheWAS to analyse possible associations between the BMI genetic risk score and a range of disease outcomes. Disease associations passing stringent correction for multiple testing (Bonferroni corrected threshold p<5.4 x 10-5, false discovery rate corrected p<0.0074) were assessed for causal association with use of inverse-variance weighted mendelian randomisation. We did sensitivity analyses to assess pleiotropy and stability of estimation with use of weighted median, weighted mode, Egger regression, and mendelian randomisation pleiotropy residual sum and outlier methods., FINDINGS: Our study population comprised 337 536 UK Biobank participants, and analyses were done for 925 unique phecodes from 17 different disease categories. After Bonferroni correction, PheWAS identified that BMI genetic risk score was associated with hospital-diagnosed obesity and 58 other outcomes; 30 distinct disease associations were supported by the mendelian randomisation analyses. 30 distinct disease associations were supported by the mendelian randomisation analyses. In inverse-variance weighted mendelian randomisation, genetically determined BMI was associated with endocrine disorders (odds ratio per one SD or 4.1 kg/m2 higher BMI 2.72, 95% CI 2.33-3.29 for type 2 diabetes; 2.11, 1.62-2.76 for type 1 diabetes; and 1.46, 1.25-1.70 for hypothyroidism), circulatory diseases (1.96, 1.53-2.51 for phlebitis and thrombophlebitis; 1.89, 1.39-2.57 for cardiomegaly; 1.68, 1.35-2.09 for congestive heart failure; 1.55, 1.37-1.76 for hypertension; 1.31, 1.13-1.52 for ischaemic heart disease; and 1.25, 1.14-1.37 for cardiac dysrhythmias), and inflammatory or dermatological conditions (2.00, 1.72-2.23 for superficial cellulitis and abscess; 3.37, 2.17-5.25 for chronic ulcers of leg and foot; 4.99, 2.54-9.82 for gangrene; and 2.24, 1.53-3.28 for atopy). Mendelian randomisation analyses provided further support for a causal effect of BMI on renal failure, osteoarthrosis, neurological (insomnia and peripheral nerve disorders) and respiratory diseases (asthma and chronic bronchitis), structural problems (hernias and knee derangement), and chemotherapy treatment. Mendelian randomisation with Egger regression produced consistently wider CIs compared with those of other methods. 26 of 72 distinct diseases detected under false discovery rate correction produced consistent estimates across at least four mendelian randomisation methods, and consistent evidence across all five approaches was obtained for 14 diseases., INTERPRETATION: Our data-driven approach identified a range of diseases as possibly affected by high BMI. This population-level screening approximated the accumulated consequences of high BMI, whereas the true effects might be more complex and vary by life stage. Our results highlight the importance of obesity prevention and effective management of obesity-related comorbidities., FUNDING: National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia.

56,A genetic risk score for fasting plasma glucose is independently associated with arterial stiffness: a Mendelian randomization study,"BACKGROUND: Arterial stiffness is known to be associated with a number of clinical conditions including hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia, and may predict cardiovascular events and mortality. However, causal links are hard to establish. Results from genome-wide association studies have identified only a few single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with arterial stiffness, the results have been inconsistent between studies and overlap with other clinical conditions is lacking. Our aim was to investigate a potential shared set of risk single nucleotide polymorphisms between relevant cardiometabolic traits and arterial stiffness., METHOD: The study population consisted of 2853 individuals (mean age 72 years, 40% men) from the population-based Malmo Diet and Cancer study, Sweden. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, a marker of arterial stiffness, was measured with Sphygmocor. Mendelian randomization analyses were performed using the two-stage least square regression and multivariate inverse-variance weighted methods., RESULTS: There were positive associations between arterial stiffness and genetic risk scores for type 2 diabetes (beta = 0.03, P = 0.04) and fasting plasma glucose (beta = 0.03, P = 0.03), but not for systolic blood pressure, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides. Multivariate inverse-variance weighted methods confirmed the significant positive association for fasting plasma glucose beta coefficients (P = 0.006), but not for type 2 diabetes beta coefficients (P = 0.88)., CONCLUSION: Genetically elevated fasting plasma glucose, but not genetically elevated risk of type 2 diabetes, was associated with arterial stiffness suggesting a causal stiffening effect of glycemia on the arterial wall, independently of type 2 diabetes.",Included,Included
104,A multi-omics study of circulating phospholipid markers of blood pressure,"High-throughput techniques allow us to measure a wide-range of phospholipids which can provide insight into the mechanisms of hypertension. We aimed to conduct an in-depth multi-omics study of various phospholipids with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The associations of blood pressure and 151 plasma phospholipids measured by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry were performed by linear regression in five European cohorts (n = 2786 in discovery and n = 1185 in replication). We further explored the blood pressure-related phospholipids in Erasmus Rucphen Family (ERF) study by associating them with multiple cardiometabolic traits (linear regression) and predicting incident hypertension (Cox regression). Mendelian Randomization (MR) and phenome-wide association study (Phewas) were also explored to further investigate these association results. We identified six phosphatidylethanolamines (PE 38:3, PE 38:4, PE 38:6, PE 40:4, PE 40:5 and PE 40:6) and two phosphatidylcholines (PC 32:1 and PC 40:5) which together predicted incident hypertension with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.61. The identified eight phospholipids are strongly associated with triglycerides, obesity related traits (e.g. waist, waist-hip ratio, total fat percentage, body mass index, lipid-lowering medication, and leptin), diabetes related traits (e.g. glucose, insulin resistance and insulin) and prevalent type 2 diabetes. The genetic determinants of these phospholipids also associated with many lipoproteins, heart rate, pulse rate and blood cell counts. No significant association was identified by bi-directional MR approach. We identified eight blood pressure-related circulating phospholipids that have a predictive value for incident hypertension. Our cross-omics analyses show that phospholipid metabolites in the circulation may yield insight into blood pressure regulation and raise a number of testable hypothesis for future research.

137,A multi-population phenome-wide association study of genetically-predicted height in the Million Veteran Program,"BACKGROUND: Height has been associated with many clinical traits but whether such associations are causal versus secondary to confounding remains unclear in many cases. To systematically examine this question, we performed a Mendelian Randomization-Phenome-wide association study (MR-PheWAS) using clinical and genetic data from a national healthcare system biobank., METHODS AND FINDINGS: Analyses were performed using data from the US Veterans Affairs (VA) Million Veteran Program in non-Hispanic White (EA, n = 222,300) and non-Hispanic Black (AA, n = 58,151) adults in the US. We estimated height genetic risk based on 3290 height-associated variants from a recent European-ancestry genome-wide meta-analysis. We compared associations of measured and genetically-predicted height with phenome-wide traits derived from the VA electronic health record, adjusting for age, sex, and genetic principal components. We found 345 clinical traits associated with measured height in EA and an additional 17 in AA. Of these, 127 were associated with genetically-predicted height at phenome-wide significance in EA and 2 in AA. These associations were largely independent from body mass index. We confirmed several previously described MR associations between height and cardiovascular disease traits such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease (CHD), and atrial fibrillation, and further uncovered MR associations with venous circulatory disorders and peripheral neuropathy in the presence and absence of diabetes. As a number of traits associated with genetically-predicted height frequently co-occur with CHD, we evaluated effect modification by CHD status of genetically-predicted height associations with risk factors for and complications of CHD. We found modification of effects of MR associations by CHD status for atrial fibrillation/flutter but not for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or venous circulatory disorders., CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that height may be an unrecognized but biologically plausible risk factor for several common conditions in adults. However, more studies are needed to reliably exclude horizontal pleiotropy as a driving force behind at least some of the MR associations observed in this study.",Excluded,Excluded
169,A phenome-wide bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis of atrial fibrillation,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasing with an aging worldwide population, yet a comprehensive understanding of its causes and consequences remains limited. We aim to assess the causes and consequences of AF via a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis., METHODS: We used publicly available genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data, centralized and harmonized by an open GWAS database. We assessed the genetically predicted effects of 5048 exposures on risk of AF, and the genetically predicted effects of genetic liability to AF, on 10 308 outcomes via two-sample MR analysis. Multivariable MR analysis was further conducted to explore the comparative roles of identified risk factors., RESULTS: MR analysis suggested that 55 out of 5048 exposure traits, including four proteins, play a causal role in AF (P <1e-5 allowing for multiple comparisons). Multivariable analysis suggested that higher body mass index, height and systolic blood pressure as well as genetic liability to coronary artery diseases independently cause AF. Three out of the four proteins (DUSP13, TNFSF12 and IL6R) had a drug prioritizing score for atrial fibrillation of 0.26, 0.38 and 0.88, respectively (values closer to 1 indicating stronger evidence of the protein as a potential drug target). Genetic liability to AF was linked to a higher risk of cardio-embolic ischaemic stroke., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest body mass index, height, systolic blood pressure and genetic liability to coronary artery disease are independent causal risk factors for AF. Several proteins, including DUSP13, IL-6R and TNFSF12, may have therapeutic potential for AF. Copyright ¬© The Author(s) 2022.

156,A two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis of modifiable risk factors and intracranial aneurysms,"We aimed to investigate the causality between potentially modifiable risk factors and the risk of intracranial aneurysm. Genetic instruments for 51 modifiable factors and intracranial aneurysm data were obtained from recently published genome-wide association studies. We applied two-sample Mendelian randomization methods to investigate their causal relationships. Genetically predicted cigarettes per day, smoking initiation, systolic blood pressure, hypertension and body fat percentage were significantly associated with an increased risk of intracranial aneurysm [odds ratios (OR) 2.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75-4.07, p = 5.36 x 10-6, OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.32-1.77, p = 9.58 x 10-9, OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.08, p = 1.18 x 10-3, OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.19-2.28, p = 2.56 x 10-3 and OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.11-1.52, p = 1.33 x 10-3, respectively]. Type 2 diabetes mellitus was significantly associated with a decreased risk of intracranial aneurysm (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83-0.95, p = 8.54 x 10-4). Body fat percentage was significantly associated with subarachnoid haemorrhage (p = 5.70 x 10-5). This study provided genetic evidence of causal effects of smoking, blood pressure, type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity on the risk of intracranial aneurysm. Copyright ¬© 2022.

88,Accelerated MRI-predicted brain ageing and its associations with cardiometabolic and brain disorders,"Brain structure in later life reflects both influences of intrinsic aging and those of lifestyle, environment and disease. We developed a deep neural network model trained on brain MRI scans of healthy people to predict ""healthy"" brain age. Brain regions most informative for the prediction included the cerebellum, hippocampus, amygdala and insular cortex. We then applied this model to data from an independent group of people not stratified for health. A phenome-wide association analysis of over 1,410 traits in the UK Biobank with differences between the predicted and chronological ages for the second group identified significant associations with over 40 traits including diseases (e.g., type I and type II diabetes), disease risk factors (e.g., increased diastolic blood pressure and body mass index), and poorer cognitive function. These observations highlight relationships between brain and systemic health and have implications for understanding contributions of the latter to late life dementia risk.",Included,Included
127,"Adult height, coronary heart disease and stroke: a multi-locus Mendelian randomization meta-analysis","Background: We investigated causal effect of completed growth, measured by adult height, on coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and cardiovascular traits, using instrumental variable (IV) Mendelian randomization meta-analysis., Methods: We developed an allele score based on 69 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with adult height, identified by the IBCCardioChip, and used it for IV analysis against cardiovascular risk factors and events in 21 studies and 60 028 participants. IV analysis on CHD was supplemented by summary data from 180 height-SNPs from the GIANT consortium and their corresponding CHD estimates derived from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D., Results: IV estimates from IBCCardioChip and GIANT-CARDIoGRAMplusC4D showed that a 6.5-cm increase in height reduced the odds of CHD by 10% [odds ratios 0.90; 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 0.78 to 1.03 and 0.85 to 0.95, respectively],which agrees with the estimate from the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration (hazard ratio 0.93; 95% CI: 0.91 to 0.94). IV analysis revealed no association with stroke (odds ratio 0.97; 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.19). IV analysis showed that a 6.5-cm increase in height resulted in lower levels of body mass index ( P < 0.001), triglycerides ( P < 0.001), non high-density (non-HDL) cholesterol ( P < 0.001), C-reactive protein ( P = 0.042), and systolic blood pressure ( P = 0.064) and higher levels of forced expiratory volume in 1 s and forced vital capacity ( P < 0.001 for both)., Conclusions: Taller individuals have a lower risk of CHD with potential explanations being that taller people have a better lung function and lower levels of body mass index, cholesterol and blood pressure.

44,Age- and sex-specific causal effects of adiposity on cardiovascular risk factors,"Observational studies have reported different effects of adiposity on cardiovascular risk factors across age and sex. Since cardiovascular risk factors are enriched in obese individuals, it has not been easy to dissect the effects of adiposity from those of other risk factors. We used a Mendelian randomization approach, applying a set of 32 genetic markers to estimate the causal effect of adiposity on blood pressure, glycemic indices, circulating lipid levels, and markers of inflammation and liver disease in up to 67,553 individuals. All analyses were stratified by age (cutoff 55 years of age) and sex. The genetic score was associated with BMI in both nonstratified analysis (P = 2.8 x 10(-107)) and stratified analyses (all P < 3.3 x 10(-30)). We found evidence of a causal effect of adiposity on blood pressure, fasting levels of insulin, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in a nonstratified analysis and in the <55-year stratum. Further, we found evidence of a smaller causal effect on total cholesterol (P for difference = 0.015) in the >=55-year stratum than in the <55-year stratum, a finding that could be explained by biology, survival bias, or differential medication. In conclusion, this study extends previous knowledge of the effects of adiposity by providing sex- and age-specific causal estimates on cardiovascular risk factors.

2,Alcohol consumption and cognitive impairment in older men: a mendelian randomization study,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether alcohol consumption is causally associated with cognitive impairment in older men as predicted by mendelian randomization., METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a cohort study of 3,542 community-dwelling men aged 65 to 83 years followed for 6 years. Cognitive impairment was established by a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 23 or less. Participants provided detailed information about their use of alcohol during the preceding year and were classified as abstainers, occasional drinkers, and regular drinkers: mild (<15 drinks/wk), moderate (15-27 drinks/wk), heavy (28-34 drinks/wk), and abusers (>=35 drinks/wk). We genotyped the rs1229984 G->A variant of the alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B) gene, which is associated with lower prevalence of alcohol abuse and dependence. Other measures included age, education, marital status, smoking and physical activity, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases., RESULTS: At study entry, rs1229984 G->A polymorphism was associated with lower prevalence of regular use of alcohol and decreased consumption among regular users. Six years later, 502 men (14.2%) showed evidence of cognitive impairment. Abstainers and irregular drinkers had higher odds of cognitive impairment than regular drinkers (odds ratio [OR] = 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.00-1.51, after adjustment for other measured factors). The rs1229984 G->A polymorphism did not decrease the odds of cognitive impairment (AA/GG OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 0.29-6.27; GA/GG OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.71-1.55)., CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol consumption, including heavy regular drinking and abuse, is not a direct cause of cognitive impairment in later life. Our results are consistent with the possibility, but do not prove, that regular moderate drinking decreases the risk of cognitive impairment in older men.",Included,Included
105,Alcohol consumption and electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy and mediation by elevated blood pressure in older Chinese men: the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study,"BACKGROUND: Chinese people have a markedly lower alcohol consumption than people in the West. Whether alcohol consumption at such levels is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, and the role of blood pressure (BP) in this relationship is unclear. We investigated the association between alcohol consumption and electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (ECG-LVH) and the mediating role of BP in Chinese men aged >=50 years., METHODS AND RESULTS: A case-control analysis was conducted on baseline cross-sectional data from the community-based Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (2003-2008), using standard 12-lead resting electrocardiograms. By comparing 191 new ECG-LVH cases with 4311 controls, excessive drinking (>210 g/week) showed excess risks for ECG-LVH (odds ratio [OR] = 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.12-3.24), after adjusting for education, income, occupation, physical activity, smoking, body mass index, fasting glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, BP, and antihypertensive medication. Mediation analysis showed a significant mediating effect of BP on the association between excessive drinking and ECG-LVH: systolic (31%) and diastolic (16%). After multivariate adjustment, no significant association was found between occasional drinking (=once/week to <=210 g/week: OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.53-1.47) with increased/decreased risk of ECG-LVH., CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol consumption at >210 g/week in Chinese men is an independent risk factor for ECG-LVH. Low power prevented us from examining whether drinking at <once/week to <=210 g/week is associated with decreased/increased risk of ECG-LVH. Elevated BP partially mediates between alcohol and ECG-LVH. A Mendelian randomization approach with a large sample size is warranted to determine the relations among alcohol consumption, BP, and LVH.

93,Alcohol use and cardiometabolic risk in the UK Biobank: A Mendelian randomization study,"Observational studies suggest alcohol use promotes the development of some adverse cardiometabolic traits but protects against others including outcomes related to coronary artery disease. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships between the degree of alcohol consumption and several cardiometabolic traits in the UK Biobank. Using the well-established ADH1B Arg47His variant (rs1229984) and up to 24 additional SNPs recently found to be associated with alcohol consumption in an independent dataset as instruments, we conducted two-stage least squares and inverse weighted variance MR analyses, both as one-sample analyses in the UK Biobank and as two-sample analyses in external consortia. In the UK Biobank inverse variance weighted analyses, we found that one additional drink of alcohol per day was positively associated with systolic blood pressure (beta = 2.65 mmHg [1.40, 3.89]), hemorrhagic stroke (OR = 2.25 [1.41, 3.60]), and atrial fibrillation (OR = 1.26 [1.07, 1.48]), which were replicated in multivariable analyses. Alcohol was also associated with all cardiovascular disease and all-cause death. A positive association with myocardial infarction did not replicate in multivariable analysis, with suggestive mediation through blood pressure; similarly, a positive association between alcohol use with type 2 diabetes was mitigated by BMI in multivariable analysis. Findings were generally null in replication with two-sample analyses. Alcohol was not protective for any disease outcome with any analysis method, dataset, or strata. Stratifications by sex and smoking in the UK Biobank revealed higher point estimates of risk for several outcomes for men and mixed results for smoking strata, but no statistically significant heterogeneity. Our results are consistent with an overall harmful and/or null effect of alcohol on cardiometabolic health at all levels of use and suggest that even moderate alcohol use should not be promoted as a part of a healthy diet and lifestyle.",Included,Included
71,Appraising the Effect of Potential Risk Factors on Thyroid Cancer: A Mendelian Randomization Study,"CONTEXT: Various risk factors have been associated with the risk of thyroid cancer in observational studies. However, the causality of the risk factors is not clear given the susceptibility of confounding and reverse causation., OBJECTIVE: A 2-sample Mendelian randomization approach was used to estimate the effect of potential risk factors on thyroid cancer risk., METHODS: Genetic instruments to proxy 55 risk factors were identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Associations of these genetic variants with thyroid cancer risk were estimated in GWAS of the FinnGen Study (989 cases and 217 803 controls). A Bonferroni-corrected threshold of P = 9.09 x 10-4 was considered significant, and P < 0.05 was considered to be suggestive of an association., RESULTS: Telomere length was significantly associated with increased thyroid cancer risk after correction for multiple testing (OR 4.68; 95% CI, 2.35-9.31; P = 1.12 x 10-5). Suggestive associations with increased risk were noted for waist-to-hip ratio (OR 1.85; 95% CI, 1.02-3.35; P = 0.042) and diastolic blood pressure (OR 1.60; 95% CI, 1.08-2.38; P = 0.019). Suggestive associations were noted between hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (OR 0.20; 95% CI, 0.05-0.82; P = 0.025) and decreased risk of thyroid cancer. Risk of thyroid cancer was not associated with sex hormones and reproduction, developmental and growth, lipids, diet and lifestyle, or inflammatory factors (All P > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Our study identified several potential targets for primary prevention of thyroid cancer, including central obesity, diastolic blood pressure, HbA1c, and telomere length, which should inform public health policy.

171,Assessment of causality between modifiable factors and heart failure: A Mendelian randomization analysis,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Observational studies have associated lifestyle, dietary, adiposity, biochemical and clinical measures with heart failure. Whether the associations are causal remains unclear. We aimed to determine the causal associations between modifiable risk factors and incidence or mortality of heart failure., METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) as genetic instruments, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to estimate the causal effects of 27 modifiable risk factors on incident heart failure (2526 cases; 20926 participants) and mortality of heart failure (1798 deaths; 2828 patients)., RESULTS: None of 27 modifiable risk factors were significantly associated with incidence or mortality of heart failure after the Bonferroni correction (p<0.0019). However, there was suggestive evidence for genetically predicted educational attainment (odds ratio [OR] per educational year increase: 0.57, 95% CI 0.33-0.99, p=0.049), circulating mono-unsaturated fatty acid concentrations (OR per 1-SD increase [ORSD] : 1.50, 1.10-2.04, p=0.011), C-reactive protein (CRP) (1.53, 1.04-2.25, p=0.031), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (0.84, 0.72-0.99, p=0.036), triglycerides (1.24, 1.00-1.52, p=0.045), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (1.06, 1.01-1.11, p=0.017) with incident heart failure., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide supporting evidence for prioritizing certain modifiable risk factors such as education, lipids, and blood pressure for primary prevention of heart failure, suggesting important clues for further mechanism research.",Included,Included
101,Assessment of the Causal Effects of Obstructive Sleep Apnea on Atrial Fibrillation: A Mendelian Randomization Study,"BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are epidemiologically correlated, but the causal relationship between them remains elusive. We aimed to explore the causal relationships between OSA and AF., METHOD: Using both the Finnish biobank and publicly available genome-wide association study data (GWAS), we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to estimate the causal effect of OSA on AF, both in the primary analysis and replicated analysis. The inverse variance weighted MR was selected as the main method. To further test the independent causal effect of OSA on AF, we also performed multivariable MR (MVMR), adjusting for body mass index (BMI), hypertension, and coronary artery disease (CAD), respectively., RESULTS: In the primary analysis, OSA was significantly associated with the increased risk of AF (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.11-1.32) and the replicated analysis showed consistent results (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05-1.30). Besides, there was no heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy observed both in the primary and replicated analysis. Further multivariable MR suggested that the causal relationships between OSA and AF exist independently of BMI and CAD. The MVMR result after the adjustment for hypertension is similar in magnitude and direction to the univariable MR. But it did not support a causal relationship between OSA and AF., CONCLUSION: Our study found that genetically driven OSA causally promotes AF. This causal relationship sheds new light on taking effective measures to prevent and treat OSA to reduce the risk of AF.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational and MR studies that were published until January 2021 and evaluated the association between obesity-related indices and CVD risk were searched. Twelve systematic reviews with 53 meta-analyses results (including over 501 cohort studies) and 12 MR studies were included in the analysis. A body mass index (BMI) increase was associated with higher risks of coronary heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, all-cause stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, ischaemic stroke, hypertension, aortic valve stenosis, pulmonary embolism, and venous thrombo-embolism. The MR study results demonstrated a causal effect of obesity on all indices but stroke. The CVD risk increase for every 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI varied from 10% [relative risk (RR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.21; certainty of evidence, low] for haemorrhagic stroke to 49% (RR 1.49; 95% CI 1.40-1.60; certainty of evidence, high) for hypertension. The all-cause and CVD-specific mortality risks increased with adiposity in cohorts, but the MR studies demonstrated no causal effect of adiposity on all-cause mortality., CONCLUSION: High adiposity is associated with increased CVD risk despite divergent evidence gradients. Adiposity was a causal risk factor for CVD except all-cause mortality and stroke. Half (49%; 26/53) of the associations were supported by high-level evidence. The associations were consistent between sexes and across global regions. This study provides guidance on how to integrate evidence from observational (association) and genetics-driven (causation) studies accumulated to date, to enable a more reliable interpretation of epidemiological relationships.

67,Association between alcohol and cardiovascular disease: Mendelian randomisation analysis based on individual participant data,"OBJECTIVE: To use the rs1229984 variant in the alcohol dehydrogenase 1B gene (ADH1B) as an instrument to investigate the causal role of alcohol in cardiovascular disease., DESIGN: Mendelian randomisation meta-analysis of 56 epidemiological studies., PARTICIPANTS: 261 991 individuals of European descent, including 20 259 coronary heart disease cases and 10 164 stroke events. Data were available on ADH1B rs1229984 variant, alcohol phenotypes, and cardiovascular biomarkers., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratio for coronary heart disease and stroke associated with the ADH1B variant in all individuals and by categories of alcohol consumption., RESULTS: Carriers of the A-allele of ADH1B rs1229984 consumed 17.2% fewer units of alcohol per week (95% confidence interval 15.6% to 18.9%), had a lower prevalence of binge drinking (odds ratio 0.78 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.84)), and had higher abstention (odds ratio 1.27 (1.21 to 1.34)) than non-carriers. Rs1229984 A-allele carriers had lower systolic blood pressure (-0.88 (-1.19 to -0.56) mm Hg), interleukin-6 levels (-5.2% (-7.8 to -2.4%)), waist circumference (-0.3 (-0.6 to -0.1) cm), and body mass index (-0.17 (-0.24 to -0.10) kg/m(2)). Rs1229984 A-allele carriers had lower odds of coronary heart disease (odds ratio 0.90 (0.84 to 0.96)). The protective association of the ADH1B rs1229984 A-allele variant remained the same across all categories of alcohol consumption (P=0.83 for heterogeneity). Although no association of rs1229984 was identified with the combined subtypes of stroke, carriers of the A-allele had lower odds of ischaemic stroke (odds ratio 0.83 (0.72 to 0.95))., CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with a genetic variant associated with non-drinking and lower alcohol consumption had a more favourable cardiovascular profile and a reduced risk of coronary heart disease than those without the genetic variant. This suggests that reduction of alcohol consumption, even for light to moderate drinkers, is beneficial for cardiovascular health. Copyright ¬© Holmes et al 2014.",Included,Included
116,Association between bilirubin and cardiovascular disease risk factors: using Mendelian randomization to assess causal inference,"BACKGROUND: Elevated serum bilirubin has been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, serum bilirubin is also related with several potential confounders related to CVD, such as obesity. Mendelian randomization has been proposed as a method to address challenges to validity from confounding and reverse causality. It utilizes genotype to estimate causal relationships between a gene product and physiological outcomes. In this report, we demonstrate its use in assessing direct causal relations between serum bilirubin levels and CVD risk factors, including obesity, cholesterol, measures of vascular function and blood pressure., METHODS: Study subjects included 868 asymptomatic individuals. Study subjects were genotyped at the UGT1A1*28 locus, which is strongly associated with bilirubin levels., RESULTS: Serum bilirubin levels were inversely associated with levels of several cardiovascular disease risk factors, including body mass index (p=0.003), LDL (p=0.0005) and total cholesterol (p=0.0002). In contrast, UGT1A1*28 genotype, a known cause of elevated bilirubin levels, was not significantly associated with any of these traditional CVD risk factors. We did observe an association between genotype and brachial artery diameter (p=0.003) and cold pressor reactivity (p=0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings imply that the observed association of serum bilirubin levels with body mass index and cholesterol are likely due to confounding and suggest that previously established CVD benefits of increased bilirubin may in part be mediated by the early regulation of vascular structure and reactivity.",Included,Included
109,Association of Body Mass Index With Cardiometabolic Disease in the UK Biobank: A Mendelian Randomization Study,"Importance: Higher body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for cardiometabolic disease; however, the underlying causal associations remain unclear., Objectives: To use UK Biobank data to report causal estimates of the association between BMI and cardiometabolic disease outcomes and traits, such as pulse rate, using mendelian randomization., Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional baseline data from a population-based cohort study including 119859 UK Biobank participants with complete phenotypic (medical and sociodemographic) and genetic data. Participants attended 1 of 22 assessment centers across the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010. The present study was conducted from May 1 to July 11, 2016., Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and type 2 diabetes were determined at assessment, based on self-report. Blood pressure was measured clinically. Participants self-reported sociodemographic information pertaining to relevant confounders. A polygenic risk score comprising 93 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with BMI from previous genome-wide association studies was constructed, and the genetic risk score was applied to derive causal estimates using a mendelian randomization approach., Results: Of the 119859 individuals included in the study, 56 816 (47.4%) were men; mean (SD) age was 56.87 (7.93) years. Mendelian randomization analysis showed significant positive associations between genetically instrumented higher BMI and risk of hypertension (odds ratio [OR] per 1-SD higher BMI, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.48-1.83; P = 1.1 x 10-19), coronary heart disease (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.09-1.69; P = .007) and type 2 diabetes (OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 2.04-3.13; P = 1.5 x 10-17), as well as systolic blood pressure (beta = 1.65 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.78-2.52 mm Hg; P = 2.0 x 10-04) and diastolic blood pressure (beta = 1.37 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.88-1.85 mm Hg; P = 3.6 x 10-08). These associations were independent of age, sex, Townsend deprivation scores, alcohol intake, and smoking history., Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this study add to the burgeoning evidence of an association between higher BMI and increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases. This finding has relevance for public health policies in many countries with increasing obesity levels.",Included,Included
162,Association of Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Lifestyle Behaviors With Hypertension: A Mendelian Randomization Study,"Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. To identify targets for the prevention of hypertension and its associated disease burden, we used the 2-sample Mendelian randomization method to investigate the causal associations of 18 cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle behaviors with hypertension. From European-descent genome-wide association studies, we selected genetic variants (P<5x10-8) for type 2 diabetes, fasting glucose, lipids, body mass index, smoking, alcohol and coffee consumption, physical activity, sleep duration, insomnia, and educational level. We extracted the genetic associations with hypertension from 2 European cohorts: the FinnGen Study (15 870 cases and 74 345 controls) and UK Biobank (54 358 cases and 408 652 controls). The inverse-variance weighted method was used as main analysis method. Genetically predicted triglycerides (pooled odds ratio [OR] per 1 SD, 1.17 [1.10-1.25]), body mass index (OR per 1 SD, 1.42 [1.37-1.48]), alcohol dependence (OR, 1.10 [1.06-1.13]), and insomnia (OR, 1.17 [1.13-1.20]) were associated with a higher odds of hypertension. Higher genetically predicted high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR per 1 SD, 0.88 [0.83-0.94]) and educational level (OR per 1 SD, 0.56 [0.54-0.59]) were associated with a lower odds of hypertension. Suggestive evidence was obtained for type 2 diabetes, smoking initiation and alcohol consumption with a higher hypertension odds, and longer sleep duration with a lower hypertension odds. This Mendelian randomization study identified high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, body mass index, alcohol dependence, insomnia, and educational level as causal risk factors for hypertension. This implicates that these modifiable risk factors are important targets in the prevention of hypertension.",Included,Included
168,Association of Serum Uric Acid with Metabolic Syndrome and Its Components: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis,"BACKGROUND: The role of uric acid on metabolic syndrome (MetS) has always been controversial. This study aims to explore associations between uric acid with MetS and its components in Chinese female health check-up population., METHODS: 1381 subjects constituted the longitudinal health check-up cohort. Health examination and genotyping were performed. Unadjusted and adjusted observational analyses were implemented to evaluate observational associations between uric acid with MetS and its components. Mendelian randomization analysis was performed to estimate the causal effect using variation at rs11722228 (SLC2A9) as an instrument for uric acid., RESULTS: An increase of 65% in risk of MetS per standard deviation increase in uric acid was found using unadjusted observational analyses. This association attenuated on adjustment for potential confounders. Similar patterns were found in the association analyses of uric acid with hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Neither by performing unadjusted nor adjusted analysis did we see evidence for association of uric acid on overweight and obesity. Mendelian randomization analyses showed no evidence of causal association between uric acid and MetS and MetS components., CONCLUSIONS: We found no causal evidence to support that increased serum uric acid is a causal risk factor for MetS or its components. Hence, there remains no strong evidence for the effeteness of undergoing urate-lowering therapy to prevent the onset of MetS or cardiovascular disease in health management.

90,"Association of Smoking, Alcohol Consumption, Blood Pressure, Body Mass Index, and Glycemic Risk Factors With Age-Related Macular Degeneration: A Mendelian Randomization Study","IMPORTANCE: Advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness in Western countries. Causal, modifiable risk factors need to be identified to develop preventive measures for advanced AMD., OBJECTIVE: To assess whether smoking, alcohol consumption, blood pressure, body mass index, and glycemic traits are associated with increased risk of advanced AMD., DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: This study used 2-sample mendelian randomization. Genetic instruments composed of variants associated with risk factors at genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10-8) were obtained from published genome-wide association studies. Summary-level statistics for these instruments were obtained for advanced AMD from the International AMD Genomics Consortium 2016 data set, which consisted of 16144 individuals with AMD and 17832 control individuals. Data were analyzed from July 2020 to September 2021., EXPOSURES: Smoking initiation, smoking cessation, lifetime smoking, age at smoking initiation, alcoholic drinks per week, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, glycated hemoglobin, fasting glucose, and fasting insulin., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Advanced AMD and its subtypes, geographic atrophy (GA), and neovascular AMD., RESULTS: A 1-SD increase in logodds of genetically predicted smoking initiation was associated with higher risk of advanced AMD (odds ratio [OR], 1.26; 95% CI, 1.13-1.40; P < .001), while a 1-SD increase in logodds of genetically predicted smoking cessation (former vs current smoking) was associated with lower risk of advanced AMD (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50-0.87; P = .003). Genetically predicted increased lifetime smoking was associated with increased risk of advanced AMD (OR per 1-SD increase in lifetime smoking behavior, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.09-1.59; P = .004). Genetically predicted alcohol consumption was associated with higher risk of GA (OR per 1-SD increase of log-transformed alcoholic drinks per week, 2.70; 95% CI, 1.48-4.94; P = .001). There was insufficient evidence to suggest that genetically predicted blood pressure, body mass index, and glycemic traits were associated with advanced AMD., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides genetic evidence that increased alcohol intake may be a causal risk factor for GA. As there are currently no known treatments for GA, this finding has important public health implications. These results also support previous observational studies associating smoking behavior with risk of advanced AMD, thus reinforcing existing public health messages regarding the risk of blindness associated with smoking.",Excluded,Excluded
31,Association of cannabis use disorder with cardiovascular diseases: A two-sample Mendelian randomization study,"Background: The use of cannabis has increased globally due to more regions decriminalizing marijuana use for therapeutic and recreational aims. Several observational studies have revealed that cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular pathologies and diseases. Nevertheless, the causal associations between cannabis use and cardiovascular diseases remain unclear. Hence, we performed single-variable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate the association between cannabis use disorder and various cardiovascular diseases., Materials and methods: Summary statistics were collected from the largest-to-date genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of cannabis use disorder. The 12 SNPs for cannabis use disorder were used as instrumental variables in this study. MR estimates were pooled using a random-effects inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method. Simple median and weighted median methods were conducted as sensitivity analyses., Results: The genetic liability to cannabis use disorder was associated with an augmented risk of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. Except for stroke, the results were inconsistent in the sensitivity analyses. The overall patterns for the associations of cannabis use disorder with atrial fibrillation, heart failure, pulmonary embolism and stroke remained in multivariable MR analyses adjusting for potential mediators, including smoking, alcohol, body mass index, blood lipid, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and depression. However, the association with coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and deep venous thrombosis did not persist in multivariable MR analyses. Mediation analysis demonstrated that smoking, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein, hypertension, and depression have more significant mediation effects, which suggests that these factors partly mediate the link from cannabis use disorder to coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and deep venous thrombosis., Conclusion: The genetic liability to cannabis use disorder was associated with a higher risk of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. The evidence for the association between cannabis use disorder, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and deep venous thrombosis was weak. Hence, future use of cannabis for therapeutic and recreational aims should consider its potential impact on cardiovascular diseases. Copyright ¬© 2022 Chen, Lu, Chen, Wang and Ma.",Included,Included
200,Association of cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle behaviors with aortic aneurysm: A Mendelian randomization study,"Objective: To examine the causality between hypertension, diabetes, other cardiovascular risk factors, lifestyle behaviors, and the aortic aneurysm among patients of European ancestry. Methods: We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causality of 12 modifiable risk factors with aortic aneurysm, including hypertension, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), diabetes, tobacco smoking, alcohol and coffee consumption, physical activity, and sleep duration. Genome-wide significant genetic instruments (p < 5 x 10-8) for risk factors were extracted from European-descent genome-wide association studies, whereas aortic aneurysm genetic instruments were selected from the UK Biobank and FinnGen cohort. The inverse-variance weighted MR was used as the main analysis, and MR-Egger (MRE), weighted median MR, MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier, and Phenoscanner searching were performed as sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, we calculated MRE intercept to detect pleiotropy and Cochran's Q statistics to assess heterogeneity and conducted bidirectional MR and MR Steiger tests to exclude the possibility of reverse causality. Results: We observed significantly higher risks for the aortic aneurysm in hypertension [pooled OR: 4.30 (95% CI 2.84-6.52)], BMI [OR: 1.58 (95% CI 1.37-1.81)], WHR [OR: 1.51 (95% CI 1.21-1.88)], WHR adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI) [OR: 1.35 (95% CI 1.12-1.63)], age of smoking initiation [OR: 1.63 (95% CI 1.18-2.26)], and tobacco use (initiation, cessation, and heaviness) [OR: 2.88 (95% CI 1.85-2.26)]. In sensitivity analysis, the causal effects of hypertension, BMI, WHRadjBMI, and tobacco use (initiation, cessation, and heaviness) remained robust.

193,Association of genetically predicted blood sucrose with coronary heart disease and its risk factors in Mendelian randomization,"We assessed the associations of genetically instrumented blood sucrose with risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and its risk factors (i.e., type 2 diabetes, adiposity, blood pressure, lipids, and glycaemic traits), using two-sample Mendelian randomization. We used blood fructose as a validation exposure. Dental caries was a positive control outcome. We selected genetic variants strongly (P < 5 x 10-6) associated with blood sucrose or fructose as instrumental variables and applied them to summary statistics from the largest available genome-wide association studies of the outcomes. Inverse-variance weighting was used as main analysis. Sensitivity analyses included weighted median, MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO. Genetically higher blood sucrose was positively associated with the control outcome, dental caries (odds ratio [OR] 1.04 per log10 transformed effect size [median-normalized standard deviation] increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.002-1.08, P = 0.04), but this association did not withstand allowing for multiple testing. The estimate for blood fructose was in the same direction. Genetically instrumented blood sucrose was not clearly associated with CHD (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.997-1.02, P = 0.14), nor with its risk factors. Findings were similar for blood fructose. Our study found some evidence of the expected detrimental effect of sucrose on dental caries but no effect on CHD. Given a small effect on CHD cannot be excluded, further investigation with stronger genetic predictors is required.",Included,Included
62,"Association of lactase persistence genotype with milk consumption, obesity and blood pressure: a Mendelian randomization study in the 1982 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort, with a systematic review and meta-analysis","BACKGROUND: Milk intake has been associated with lower blood pressure (BP) in observational studies, and randomized controlled trials suggested that milk-derived tripeptides have BP-lowering effects. Milk intake has also been associated with body mass index (BMI). Nevertheless, it is unclear whether increasing milk consumption would reduce BP in the general population., METHODS: We investigated the association of milk intake with obesity and BP using genetically-defined lactase persistence (LP) based on the rs4988235 polymorphism in a Mendelian randomization design in the 1982 Pelotas (Southern Brazil) Birth Cohort. These results were combined with published reports identified through a systematic review using meta-analysis., RESULTS: In the 1982 Pelotas Birth Cohort, milk intake was 42 [95% confidence interval (CI): 18; 67) ml/day higher in LP individuals. In conventional observational analysis, each 1-dl/day increase in milk intake was associated with -0.26 (95% CI: -0.33; -0.19) kg/m2 in BMI and -0.31 (95% CI: -0.46; -0.16) and -0.35 (95% CI: -0.46; -0.23) mmHg in systolic and diastolic BP, respectively. These results were not corroborated when analysing LP status, but confidence intervals were large. In random effects meta-analysis, LP individuals presented higher BMI [0.17 (95% CI: 0.07; 0.27) kg/m2] and higher odds of overweight-obesity [1.09 (95% CI: 1.02; 1.17)]. There were no reliable associations for BP., CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports that LP is positively associated with obesity, suggesting that the negative association of milk intake with obesity is likely due to limitations of conventional observational studies. Our findings also do not support that increased milk intake leads to lower BP. Copyright ¬© The Author 2016.

However, when using genotypic instruments for uric acid and hyperuricaemia, we saw no evidence for causal associations between uric acid, ischaemic heart disease, and blood pressure. We used genetic instruments to investigate body mass index as a potentially confounding factor in observational associations, and saw a causal effect on uric acid levels. Every four unit increase of body mass index saw a rise in uric acid of 0.03 mmol/L (95% confidence interval 0.02 to 0.04), and an increase in risk of hyperuricaemia of 7.5% (3.9% to 11.1%)., CONCLUSION: By contrast with observational findings, there is no strong evidence for causal associations between uric acid and ischaemic heart disease or blood pressure. However, evidence supports a causal effect between body mass index and uric acid level and hyperuricaemia. This finding strongly suggests body mass index as a confounder in observational associations, and suggests a role for elevated body mass index or obesity in the development of uric acid related conditions.",Included,Included
65,Association of serum HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 levels with risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Individuals with features of metabolic syndrome are particularly susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus associated with the severe respiratory disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Despite considerable attention dedicated to COVID-19, the link between metabolic syndrome and SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Using data from the UK Biobank, we investigated the relationship between severity of COVID-19 and metabolic syndrome-related serum biomarkers measured prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Logistic regression analyses were used to test biomarker levels and biomarker-associated genetic variants with SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes. Among SARS-CoV-2-positive cases and negative controls, a 10 mg/dl increase in serum HDL-cholesterol or apolipoprotein A1 levels was associated with ~10% reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, after adjustment for age, sex, obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease. Evaluation of known genetic variants for HDL-cholesterol revealed that individuals homozygous for apolipoprotein E4 alleles had ~2- to 3-fold higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or mortality from COVID-19 compared with apolipoprotein E3 homozygotes, even after adjustment for HDL-cholesterol levels. However, cumulative effects of all evaluated HDL-cholesterol-raising alleles and Mendelian randomization analyses did not reveal association of genetically higher HDL-cholesterol levels with decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results implicate serum HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 levels measured prior to SAR-CoV-2 exposure as clinical risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection but do not provide evidence that genetically elevated HDL-cholesterol levels are associated with SAR-CoV-2 infection.

165,Association of vitamin D status with arterial blood pressure and hypertension risk: a mendelian randomisation study,"BACKGROUND: Low plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration is associated with high arterial blood pressure and hypertension risk, but whether this association is causal is unknown. We used a mendelian randomisation approach to test whether 25(OH)D concentration is causally associated with blood pressure and hypertension risk., METHODS: In this mendelian randomisation study, we generated an allele score (25[OH]D synthesis score) based on variants of genes that affect 25(OH)D synthesis or substrate availability (CYP2R1 and DHCR7), which we used as a proxy for 25(OH)D concentration. We meta-analysed data for up to 108 173 individuals from 35 studies in the D-CarDia collaboration to investigate associations between the allele score and blood pressure measurements. We complemented these analyses with previously published summary statistics from the International Consortium on Blood Pressure (ICBP), the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium, and the Global Blood Pressure Genetics (Global BPGen) consortium., FINDINGS: In phenotypic analyses (up to n=49 363), increased 25(OH)D concentration was associated with decreased systolic blood pressure (beta per 10% increase, -0.12 mm Hg, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.04; p=0.003) and reduced odds of hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99; p=0.0003), but not with decreased diastolic blood pressure (beta per 10% increase, -0.02 mm Hg, -0.08 to 0.03; p=0.37). In meta-analyses in which we combined data from D-CarDia and the ICBP (n=146 581, after exclusion of overlapping studies), each 25(OH)D-increasing allele of the synthesis score was associated with a change of -0.10 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure (-0.21 to -0.0001; p=0.0498) and a change of -0.08 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure (-0.15 to -0.02; p=0.01). When D-CarDia and consortia data for hypertension were meta-analysed together (n=142 255), the synthesis score was associated with a reduced odds of hypertension (OR per allele, 0.98, 0.96-0.99; p=0.001). In instrumental variable analysis, each 10% increase in genetically instrumented 25(OH)D concentration was associated with a change of -0.29 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure (-0.52 to -0.07; p=0.01), a change of -0.37 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure (-0.73 to 0.003; p=0.052), and an 8.1% decreased odds of hypertension (OR 0.92, 0.87-0.97; p=0.002)., INTERPRETATION: Increased plasma concentrations of 25(OH)D might reduce the risk of hypertension.

130,Associations between Potentially Modifiable Risk Factors and Alzheimer Disease: A Mendelian Randomization Study,"BACKGROUND: Potentially modifiable risk factors including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking are associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) and represent promising targets for intervention. However, the causality of these associations is unclear. We sought to assess the causal nature of these associations using Mendelian randomization (MR)., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used SNPs associated with each risk factor as instrumental variables in MR analyses. We considered type 2 diabetes (T2D, NSNPs = 49), fasting glucose (NSNPs = 36), insulin resistance (NSNPs = 10), body mass index (BMI, NSNPs = 32), total cholesterol (NSNPs = 73), HDL-cholesterol (NSNPs = 71), LDL-cholesterol (NSNPs = 57), triglycerides (NSNPs = 39), systolic blood pressure (SBP, NSNPs = 24), smoking initiation (NSNPs = 1), smoking quantity (NSNPs = 3), university completion (NSNPs = 2), and years of education (NSNPs = 1). We calculated MR estimates of associations between each exposure and AD risk using an inverse-variance weighted approach, with summary statistics of SNP-AD associations from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project, comprising a total of 17,008 individuals with AD and 37,154 cognitively normal elderly controls. We found that genetically predicted higher SBP was associated with lower AD risk (odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation [15.4 mm Hg] of SBP [95% CI]: 0.75 [0.62-0.91]; p = 3.4 x 10(-3)). Genetically predicted higher SBP was also associated with a higher probability of taking antihypertensive medication (p = 6.7 x 10(-8)). Genetically predicted smoking quantity was associated with lower AD risk (OR per ten cigarettes per day [95% CI]: 0.67 [0.51-0.89]; p = 6.5 x 10(-3)), although we were unable to stratify by smoking history; genetically predicted smoking initiation was not associated with AD risk (OR = 0.70 [0.37, 1.33]; p = 0.28). We saw no evidence of causal associations between glycemic traits, T2D, BMI, or educational attainment and risk of AD (all p > 0.1). Potential limitations of this study include the small proportion of intermediate trait variance explained by genetic variants and other implicit limitations of MR analyses., CONCLUSIONS: Inherited lifetime exposure to higher SBP is associated with lower AD risk. These findings suggest that higher blood pressure--or some environmental exposure associated with higher blood pressure, such as use of antihypertensive medications--may reduce AD risk.",Included,Included

Approach and Results- We measured plasma protein levels using the Olink ProSeek CVD I or II+III arrays and analyzed 57 proteins available in 3 population-based cohorts: EpiHealth (n=2029; 52% women; median age, 61 years), PIVUS (Prospective Study of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors; n=790; 51% women; all aged 70 years), and ULSAM (Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men; n=551; all men aged 77 years). A discovery analysis was performed in EpiHealth in a regression framework (adjusted for sex, age, body mass index, smoking, glucose levels, systolic blood pressure, blood pressure medication, diabetes mellitus medication, and CVD history), and associations with false discovery rate <0.05 were further tested in PIVUS and ULSAM, where a P value of 0.05 was considered a successful replication (validation false discovery rate of 0.1%). We used summary statistics from a genome-wide association study on each protein biomarker (meta-analysis of EpiHealth, PIVUS, ULSAM, and IMPROVE [Carotid Intima-Media Thickness and IMT-Progression as Predictors of Vascular Events in a High-Risk European Population]) and publicly available data from Global Lipids Genetics Consortium to perform Mendelian randomization analyses to address possible causality of protein levels. Of 57 tested proteins, 42 demonstrated an association with at least 1 lipid fraction; 35 were associated with TG, 15 with total cholesterol, 9 with LDL cholesterol, and 24 with HDL cholesterol. Among these associations, we found KIM-1 (kidney injury molecule-1), TNFR (TNF [tumor necrosis factor] receptor) 1 and 2, TRAIL-R2 (TRAIL [TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand] receptor 2), and RETN (resistin) to be associated with all 4 lipid fractions. Further, 15 proteins were related to both TG and HDL cholesterol in a consistent and biologically expected manner, that is, higher TG and lower HDL cholesterol or vice versa. Another common pattern of associations was concomitantly higher TG, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol, which is associated with higher CVD risk. We did not find evidence of causal links for protein levels. Conclusions - Our comprehensive analysis of plasma proteins and lipid fractions of 3370 individuals from the general population provides new information about lipid metabolism.",Included,Included
73,"Associations of Visceral Adipose Tissue, Circulating Protein Biomarkers, and Risk of Cardiovascular Diseases: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis","Aim: To evaluate the genetic associations of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass with metabolic risk factors and cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints and to construct a network analysis about the underlying mechanism using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Methods and Results: Using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we conducted the two-sample MR to assess the effects of VAT mass on 10 metabolic risk factors and 53 CVD endpoints. Genetically predicted VAT mass was associated with metabolic risk factors, including triglyceride (odds ratio, OR, 1.263 [95% confidence interval, CI, 1.203-1.326]), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR, 0.719 [95% CI, 0.678-0.763]), type 2 diabetes (OR, 2.397 [95% CI, 1.965-2.923]), fasting glucose (OR, 1.079 [95% CI, 1.046-1.113]), fasting insulin (OR, 1.194 [95% CI, 1.16-1.229]), and insulin resistance (OR, 1.204 [95% CI, 1.16-1.25]). Genetically predicted VAT mass was associated with CVD endpoints, including atrial fibrillation (OR, 1.414 [95% CI, 1.332 = 1.5]), coronary artery disease (OR, 1.573 [95% CI, 1.439 = 1.72]), myocardial infarction (OR, 1.633 [95% CI, 1.484 =1.796]), heart failure (OR, 1.711 [95% CI, 1.599-1.832]), any stroke (OR, 1.29 [1.193-1.394]), ischemic stroke (OR, 1.292 [1.189-1.404]), large artery stroke (OR, 1.483 [1.206-1.823]), cardioembolic stroke (OR, 1.261 [1.096-1.452]), and intracranial aneurysm (OR, 1.475 [1.235-1.762]). In the FinnGen study, the relevance of VAT mass to coronary heart disease, stroke, cardiac arrhythmia, vascular diseases, hypertensive heart disease, and cardiac death was found. In network analysis to identify the underlying mechanism between VAT and CVDs, VAT mass was positively associated with 23 cardiovascular-related proteins (e.g., Leptin, Hepatocyte growth factor, interleukin-16), and inversely with 6 proteins (e.g., Galanin peptides, Endothelial cell-specific molecule 1). These proteins were further associated with 32 CVD outcomes. Conclusion: Mendelian randomization analysis has shown that VAT mass was associated with a wide range of CVD outcomes including coronary heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, vascular diseases, and stroke. A few circulating proteins may be the mediators between VAT and CVDs. Copyright ¬© 2022 Huang, Liu, Ma, Tu, Liu, Bai, Xiao, Liu, Hu, Lin, Li, Ning, Zhou, Mao and Liu.",Included,Included
51,Associations of genetically predicted IL-6 signaling with cardiovascular disease risk across population subgroups,"BACKGROUND: Interleukin 6 (IL-6) signaling is being investigated as a therapeutic target for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). While changes in circulating high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) are used as a marker of IL-6 signaling, it is not known whether there is effect heterogeneity in relation to baseline hsCRP levels or other cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of this study was to explore the association of genetically predicted IL-6 signaling with CVD risk across populations stratified by baseline hsCRP levels and cardiovascular risk factors., METHODS: Among 397,060 White British UK Biobank participants without known CVD at baseline, we calculated a genetic risk score for IL-6 receptor (IL-6R)-mediated signaling, composed of 26 variants at the IL6R gene locus. We then applied linear and non-linear Mendelian randomization analyses exploring associations with a combined endpoint of incident coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, peripheral artery disease, aortic aneurysm, and cardiovascular death stratifying by baseline hsCRP levels and cardiovascular risk factors., RESULTS: The study participants (median age 59 years, 53.9% females) were followed-up for a median of 8.8 years, over which time a total of 46,033 incident cardiovascular events occurred. Genetically predicted IL-6R-mediated signaling activity was associated with higher CVD risk (hazard ratio per 1-mg/dL increment in absolute hsCRP levels: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06-1.17). The increase in CVD risk was linearly related to baseline absolute hsCRP levels. There was no evidence of heterogeneity in the association of genetically predicted IL-6R-mediated signaling with CVD risk when stratifying the population by sex, age, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, or systolic blood pressure, but there was evidence of greater associations in individuals with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol >= 160 mg/dL., CONCLUSIONS: Any benefit of inhibiting IL-6 signaling for CVD risk reduction is likely to be proportional to absolute reductions in hsCRP levels. Therapeutic inhibition of IL-6 signaling for CVD risk reduction should therefore prioritize those individuals with the highest baseline levels of hsCRP. Copyright ¬© 2022.

21,"Avoiding dynastic, assortative mating, and population stratification biases in Mendelian randomization through within-family analyses","Estimates from Mendelian randomization studies of unrelated individuals can be biased due to uncontrolled confounding from familial effects. Here we describe methods for within-family Mendelian randomization analyses and use simulation studies to show that family-based analyses can reduce such biases. We illustrate empirically how familial effects can affect estimates using data from 61,008 siblings from the Nord-Trondelag Health Study and UK Biobank and replicated our findings using 222,368 siblings from 23andMe. Both Mendelian randomization estimates using unrelated individuals and within family methods reproduced established effects of lower BMI reducing risk of diabetes and high blood pressure. However, while Mendelian randomization estimates from samples of unrelated individuals suggested that taller height and lower BMI increase educational attainment, these effects were strongly attenuated in within-family Mendelian randomization analyses. Our findings indicate the necessity of controlling for population structure and familial effects in Mendelian randomization studies.",Included,Included
153,BMI Is Causally Associated With Pulmonary Artery Pressure But Not Hemodynamic Evidence of Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling,"BACKGROUND: There is an unclear relationship of obesity to the pathogenesis and severity of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and pulmonary venous hypertension (PVH)., RESEARCH QUESTION: Is BMI casually associated with pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and/or markers of pulmonary vascular remodeling?, STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The study design was a two-sample inverse-variance weighted Mendelian randomization. We constructed two BMI genetic risk scores from genome-wide association study summary data and deployed them in nonoverlapping cohorts of subjects referred for right heart catheterization (RHC) or echocardiography. A BMI highly polygenic risk score (hpGRS) optimally powered to detect shared genetic architecture of obesity with other traits was tested for association with RHC parameters including markers of pulmonary vascular remodeling. A BMI strict genetic risk score (sGRS) composed of high-confidence genetic variants was used for Mendelian randomization analyses to assess if higher BMI causes higher PAP., RESULTS: Among all subjects, both directly measured BMI and hpGRS were positively associated with pulmonary arterial pressures but not markers of pulmonary vascular remodeling. Categorical analyses revealed BMI and hpGRS were associated with PVH but not PAH. Mendelian randomization of the sGRS supported that higher BMI is causal of higher systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP). Sensitivity analyses showed sPAP-BMI sGRS relationship was preserved when either individuals with PAH or PVH were excluded. In the echocardiographic cohort, BMI and hpGRS were positively associated with estimated PAP and markers of left heart remodeling., INTERPRETATION: BMI is a modifier of pulmonary hypertension severity in both PAH and PVH but is only involved in the pathogenesis of PVH.

45,"Birth weight, childhood obesity and risk of hypertension: a Mendelian randomization study","PURPOSES: Observational studies indicate that birth weight and childhood obesity are associated with essential hypertension, but their causal effect on essential hypertension remains unclear. The aim of our study is to elucidate the causal relationship between birth weight, childhood obesity, and essential hypertension by Mendelian randomization (MR) with genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs)., METHODS: We identified IVs based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with birth weight (n = 160 295) and childhood obesity (n = 6889, 1509 cases and 5380 controls) from the meta-analysis of a genome-wide association study. Summary level data from the UK Biobank essential hypertension consortium (n = 463 010, 54 358 cases and 408 652 controls) was used to analyze the relationship between IVs and essential hypertension. Two MR analysis methods, two threshold values of selecting IVs, and leave-one-out analysis were used to ensure the robustness of the results., RESULTS: Genetic predisposition to higher birth weight did not increase the risk of essential hypertension. In contrast, per one standard deviation increase in childhood body mass index was significantly associated with an increased risk of essential hypertension (odds ratio = 1.0075, 95% confidence interval: 1.0035-1.0116) when using seven SNPs that achieved genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10-8). Sensitivity analysis and MR-Egger regression indicated that the results were robust and not influenced by pleiotropy., CONCLUSIONS: No evidence of an association between birth weight and essential hypertension was found. Childhood obesity, however, showed a causal relationship with the risk of essential hypertension, which was helpful to understand the mechanisms of essential hypertension and develop strategies for its prevention.

190,"Birthweight, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, and Cardiovascular Disease: Addressing the Barker Hypothesis With Mendelian Randomization","BACKGROUND: Low birthweight has been associated with a higher risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), and cardiovascular disease. The Barker hypothesis posits that intrauterine growth restriction resulting in lower birthweight is causal for these diseases, but causality is difficult to infer from observational studies., METHODS: We performed regression analyses to assess associations of birthweight with cardiovascular disease and T2D in 237 631 individuals from the UK Biobank. Further, we assessed the causal relationship of such associations using Mendelian randomization., RESULTS: In the observational analyses, birthweight showed inverse associations with systolic and diastolic blood pressure (beta, -0.83 and -0.26; per raw unit in outcomes and SD change in birthweight; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.90 to -0.75 and -0.31 to -0.22, respectively), T2D (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.79-0.87), lipid-lowering treatment (odds ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.81-0.86), and coronary artery disease (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.94), whereas the associations with adult body mass index and body fat (beta, 0.04 and 0.02; per SD change in outcomes and birthweight; 95% CI, 0.03-0.04 and 0.01-0.02, respectively) were positive. The Mendelian randomization analyses indicated inverse causal associations of birthweight with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 2-hour glucose, coronary artery disease, and T2D and positive causal association with body mass index but no associations with blood pressure., CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that lower birthweight, used as a proxy for intrauterine growth retardation, is causally related with increased susceptibility to coronary artery disease and T2D. This causal relationship is not mediated by adult obesity or hypertension. Copyright ¬© 2018 The Authors.",Included,Included
5,"Blood Eosinophil Count and Metabolic, Cardiac and Pulmonary Outcomes: A Mendelian Randomization Study","Blood eosinophil count is associated with a variety of common complex outcomes in epidemiological observation. The aim of this study was to explore the causal association between determined blood eosinophil count and 20 common complex outcomes (10 metabolic, 6 cardiac, and 4 pulmonary). Through Mendelian randomization, we investigated genetic evidence for the genetically determined eosinophil in association with each outcomes using individual-level LifeLines cohort data (n = 13,301), where a weighted eosinophil genetic risk score comprising five eosinophil associated variants was created. We further examined the associations of the genetically determined eosinophil with those outcomes using summary statistics obtained from genome-wide association study consortia (6 consortia and 14 outcomes). Blood eosinophil count, by a 1-SD genetically increased, was not statistically associated with common complex outcomes in the LifeLines. Using the summary statistics, we showed that a higher genetically determined eosinophil count had a significant association with lower odds of obesity (odds ratio (OR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.74, 0.89]) but not with the other traits and diseases. To conclude, an elevated eosinophil count is unlikely to be causally associated to higher risk of metabolic, cardiac, and pulmonary outcomes. Further studies with a stronger genetic risk score for eosinophil count may support these results.",Included,Included
26,Blood pressure and risk of cancer: a Mendelian randomization study,"BACKGROUND: Previous large observational cohort studies showed higher blood pressure (BP) positively associated with cancer. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to obtain less confounded estimates of BP on total and site-specific cancers., METHODS: We applied replicated genetic instruments for systolic and diastolic BP to summary genetic associations with total cancer (37387 cases, 367856 non-cases) from the UK Biobank, and 17 site-specific cancers (663-17881 cases) from a meta-analysis of the UK Biobank and the Kaiser Permanente Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging. We used inverse-variance weighting with multiplicative random effects as the main analysis, and sensitivity analyses including the weighted median, MR-Egger and multivariable MR adjusted for body mass index and for smoking. For validation, we included breast (Breast Cancer Association Consortium: 133384 cases, 113789 non-cases), prostate (Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome Consortium: 79194 cases, 61112 non-cases) and lung (International Lung and Cancer Consortium: 10246 cases, 38295 non-cases) cancer from large consortia. We used asthma as a negative control outcome., RESULTS: Systolic and diastolic BP were unrelated to total cancer (OR 0.98 per standard deviation higher [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89, 1.07] and OR 1.00 [95% CI 0.92, 1.08]) and to site-specific cancers after accounting for multiple testing, with consistent findings from consortia. BP was nominally associated with melanoma and possibly kidney cancer, and as expected, not associated with asthma. Sensitivity analyses using other MR methods gave similar results., CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous observational evidence, BP does not appear to be a risk factor for cancer, although an effect on melanoma and kidney cancer cannot be excluded. Other targets for cancer prevention might be more relevant. Copyright ¬© 2021. The Author(s).",Included,Included
95,Body mass index and body composition in relation to 14 cardiovascular conditions in UK Biobank: a Mendelian randomization study,"AIMS: The causal role of adiposity for several cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is unclear. Our primary aim was to apply the Mendelian randomization design to investigate the associations of body mass index (BMI) with 13 CVDs and arterial hypertension. We also assessed the roles of fat mass and fat-free mass on the same outcomes., METHODS AND RESULTS: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with BMI and fat mass and fat-free mass indices were used as instrumental variables to estimate the associations with the cardiovascular conditions among 367 703 UK Biobank participants. After correcting for multiple testing, genetically predicted BMI was significantly positively associated with eight outcomes, including and with decreasing magnitude of association: aortic valve stenosis, heart failure, deep vein thrombosis, arterial hypertension, peripheral artery disease, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and pulmonary embolism. The odds ratio (OR) per 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI ranged from 1.06 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.11; P = 2.6 x 10-3] for pulmonary embolism to 1.13 (95% CI 1.05-1.21; P = 1.2 x 10-3) for aortic valve stenosis. There was suggestive evidence of positive associations of genetically predicted fat mass index with nine outcomes (P < 0.05). The strongest magnitude of association was with aortic valve stenosis (OR per 1 kg/m2 increase in fat mass index 1.46, 95% CI 1.13-1.88; P = 3.9 x 10-3). There was suggestive evidence of inverse associations of fat-free mass index with atrial fibrillation, ischaemic stroke, and abdominal aortic aneurysm., CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that higher BMI and particularly fat mass index are associated with increased risk of aortic valve stenosis and most other cardiovascular conditions.

158,C-reactive protein and its role in metabolic syndrome: mendelian randomisation study,"BACKGROUND: Circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with the metabolic syndrome and might be causally linked to it. Our aim was to generate estimates of the association between plasma CRP and metabolic syndrome phenotypes that were free from confounding and reverse causation, to assess the causal role of this protein., METHODS: We examined associations between serum CRP concentration and metabolic syndrome phenotypes in the British Women's Heart and Health Study. We then compared these estimates with those derived from a mendelian randomised framework with common CRP gene haplotypes to generate unconfounded and unbiased estimates of any causal associations., FINDINGS: In a sample of British women, body-mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, waist-to-hip ratio, serum concentrations of HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and insulin resistance were all associated with plasma CRP concentration. CRP haplotypes were associated with plasma CRP concentration (p<0.0001). With instrumental variable analyses, there was no association between plasma CRP concentration and any of the metabolic syndrome phenotypes analysed. There was strong evidence that linear regression and mendelian randomisation based estimation gave conflicting results for the CRP-BMI association (p=0.0002), and some evidence of conflicting results for the association of CRP with the score for insulin resistance (p=0.0139), triglycerides (p=0.0313), and HDL cholesterol (p=0.0688)., INTERPRETATION: Disparity between estimates of the association between plasma CRP and phenotypes comprising the metabolic syndrome derived from conventional analyses and those from a mendelian randomisation approach suggests that there is no causal association between CRP and the metabolic syndrome phenotypes.",Included,Included
0,Can increasing years of schooling reduce type 2 diabetes (T2D)?: Evidence from a Mendelian randomization of T2D and 10 of its risk factors,"A focus in recent decades has involved examining the potential causal impact of educational attainment (schooling years) on a variety of disease and life-expectancy outcomes. Numerous studies have broadly revealed a link suggesting that as years of formal schooling increase so too does health and wellbeing; however, it is unclear whether the associations are causal. Here we use Mendelian randomization, an instrumental variables technique, with a two-sample design, to probe whether more years of schooling are causally linked to type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 10 of its attendant risk factors. The results revealed a protective effect of more schooling years against T2D (odds ratio = 0.39; 95% confidence interval: 0.26, 0.58; P = 3.89 x 10-06), which in turn might be partly mediated by more years of schooling being protective against the following: having a father with T2D, being overweight, having higher blood pressure and higher levels of circulating triglycerides, and having lower levels of HDL cholesterol. More schooling years had no effect on risk for gestational diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome and was associated with a decreased likelihood of moderate physical activity. These findings imply that strategies to retain adults in higher education may help reduce the risk for a major source of metabolic morbidity and mortality.",Included,Included

Trait-specific polygenic risk scores for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, triglyceride levels, body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, and systolic blood pressure (BP) were used to test the associations of genetically predicted elevations in each trait with incident OA diagnosis (n = 3,559), OA joint replacement (n = 2,780), or both (total OA; n = 4,226) in Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses in the MDCS, and with self-reported and/or hospital-diagnosed OA (n = 65,213) in the UK Biobank. Multivariable MR, MR-Egger, and weighted median MR were used to adjust for potential pleiotropic biases., RESULTS: In the MDCS, genetically predicted elevation in LDL cholesterol level was associated with a lower risk of OA diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] 0.83 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.73-0.95] per 1SD increase) and total OA (OR 0.87 [95% CI 0.78-0.98]), which was supported by multivariable MR for OA diagnosis (OR 0.84 [95% CI 0.75-0.95]) and total OA (0.87 [95% CI 0.78-0.97]), and by conventional 2-sample MR for OA diagnosis (OR 0.86 [95% CI 0.75-0.98]). MR-Egger indicated no pleiotropic bias. Genetically predicted elevation in BMI was associated with an increased risk of OA diagnosis (OR 1.65 [95% CI 1.14-2.41]), while MR-Egger indicated pleiotropic bias and a larger association with OA diagnosis (OR 3.25 [1.26-8.39]), OA joint replacement (OR 3.81 [95% CI 1.39-10.4]), and total OA (OR 3.41 [95% CI 1.43-8.15]).

106,Cardiometabolic risks of SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization using Mendelian Randomization,"Many cardiometabolic conditions have demonstrated associative evidence with COVID-19 hospitalization risk. However, the observational designs of the studies in which these associations are observed preclude causal inferences of hospitalization risk. Mendelian Randomization (MR) is an alternative risk estimation method more robust to these limitations that allows for causal inferences. We applied four MR methods (MRMix, IMRP, IVW, MREgger) to publicly available GWAS summary statistics from European (COVID-19 GWAS n = 2956) and multi-ethnic populations (COVID-19 GWAS n = 10,908) to better understand extant causal associations between Type II Diabetes (GWAS n = 659,316), BMI (n = 681,275), diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and pulse pressure (n = 757,601 for each) and COVID-19 hospitalization risk across populations. Although no significant causal effect evidence was observed, our data suggested a trend of increasing hospitalization risk for Type II diabetes (IMRP OR, 95% CI 1.67, 0.96-2.92) and pulse pressure (OR, 95% CI 1.27, 0.97-1.66) in the multi-ethnic sample.

Genetic instruments and association estimates for body mass index (BMI), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), systolic blood pressure (SBP), smoking and education were obtained from existing GWAS summary data (sample sizes 188,577-866,834 individuals). Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to investigate the effects of exposure traits on OA risk. MR mediation analyses were undertaken to investigate whether the cardiometabolic traits mediate any effect of education on OA risk., RESULTS: MR analyses identified protective effects of higher genetically predicted education (main MR analysis odds ratio (OR) per standard deviation increase 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-0.64) and LDL-C levels (OR 0.94, 95%CI 0.91-0.98) on OA risk, and unfavourable effects of higher genetically predicted BMI (OR 1.82, 95%CI 1.73-1.92) and smoking (OR 2.23, 95%CI 1.85-2.68). There was no strong evidence of an effect of genetically predicted SBP on OA risk (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90-1.06). The proportion of the effect of genetically predicted education mediated through genetically predicted BMI and smoking was 35% (95%CI 13-57%)., CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight education, obesity and smoking as common mechanisms underlying OA and cardiovascular disease. These risk factors represent clinical and public health targets for reducing multi-morbidity related to the burden these common conditions. Copyright ¬© 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Methods and Results Independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with height (positive control), body mass index, type 2 diabetes, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, smoking, alcohol and coffee consumption, 7 circulating vitamins (A, B6, B9, B12, C, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and E), and 5 circulating minerals (calcium, iron, magnesium, selenium, and zinc) at the genome-wide significance level were used as instrumental variables. Summary-level data for the genetic associations with varicose veins were obtained from the UK Biobank (8763 cases and 352 431 noncases) and the FinnGen consortium (13 928 cases and 153 951 noncases). Genetically predicted higher height, body mass index, smoking, and circulating iron levels were associated with an increased risk of varicose veins. The odds ratios (ORs) per 1-SD increase in the exposure were 1.34 (95% CI, 1.25-1.43) for height, 1.39 (95% CI, 1.27-1.52) for body mass index, 1.12 (95% CI, 1.04-1.22) for the prevalence of smoking initiation, and 1.24 (95% CI, 1.16-1.33) for iron. Higher genetically predicted systolic blood pressure and circulating calcium and zinc levels were associated with a reduced risk of varicose veins, whereas the association for systolic blood pressure did not persist after adjustment for genetically predicted height. The OR was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.62-0.92) per 1-SD increase in calcium levels and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95-0.98) for zinc.

161,Cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle behaviours in relation to longevity: a Mendelian randomization study,"BACKGROUND: The American Heart Association introduced the Life's Simple 7 initiative to improve cardiovascular health by modifying cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle behaviours. It is unclear whether these risk factors are causally associated with longevity., OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate causal associations of Life's Simple 7 modifiable risk factors, as well as sleep and education, with longevity using the two-sample Mendelian randomization design., METHODS: Instrumental variables for the modifiable risk factors were obtained from large-scale genome-wide association studies. Data on longevity beyond the 90th survival percentile were extracted from a genome-wide association meta-analysis with 11,262 cases and 25,483 controls whose age at death or last contact was <= the 60th survival percentile., RESULTS: Risk factors associated with a lower odds of longevity included the following: genetic liability to type 2 diabetes (OR 0.88; 95% CI: 0.84;0.92), genetically predicted systolic and diastolic blood pressure (per 1-mmHg increase: 0.96; 0.94;0.97 and 0.95; 0.93;0.97), body mass index (per 1-SD increase: 0.80; 0.74;0.86), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (per 1-SD increase: 0.75; 0.65;0.86) and smoking initiation (0.75; 0.66;0.85). Genetically increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (per 1-SD increase: 1.23; 1.08;1.41) and educational level (per 1-SD increase: 1.64; 1.45;1.86) were associated with a higher odds of longevity. Fasting glucose and other lifestyle factors were not significantly associated with longevity., CONCLUSION: Most of the Life's Simple 7 modifiable risk factors are causally related to longevity. Prevention strategies should focus on modifying these risk factors and reducing education inequalities to improve cardiovascular health and longevity. Copyright ¬© 2020 The Authors.

55,Causal Effect of Adiposity Measures on Blood Pressure Traits in 2 Urban Swedish Cohorts: A Mendelian Randomization Study,"Background Different adiposity traits may be causally related to hypertension in different ways. By using genetic variants as randomly allocated proxies for studying the effect of modifying adiposity traits, the Mendelian randomization approach can be used to investigate this. Methods and Results In this study, we used 4 different genetic risk scores (GRS; GRS-BMI565, GRS-WHR324, GRS-VAT208, GRS-BF81) including hundreds of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, visceral adipose tissue, and body fat, respectively. These were applied as instrumental variables in Mendelian randomization analyses. Two Swedish urban-based cohort studies, the Malmo Diet and Cancer, and the Malmo Preventive 795Projects were used to obtain genetic association estimates with blood pressure (BP). In both the Malmo Preventive Projects and Malmo Diet and Cancer studies, except for that for body fat, all of the genetic risk scores were significantly associated with systolic BP and diastolic BP, but with different magnitudes. In particular, in both cohorts, each standard deviation increase in the genetic risk score made up by the 324 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with waist-to-hip ratio was associated with doubling of the likelihood of hypertension prevalence at baseline. However, only the genetic risk score made up by the 565 SNPs associated with body mass index was significantly associated with hypertension incidence during 23.6+/-4.3 years of follow-up in the Malmo Preventive Project. Conclusions We support a causal link between genetically mediated adiposity, especially waist-to-hip ratio and body mass index, and BP traits including hypertension prevalence and, for the first time to our knowledge, hypertension incidence. The differences in magnitude between these associations might suggest different mechanisms by which different adiposity affects BP/hypertension and consequently may indicate that tailored interventions are needed to reduce cardiovascular risk.",Included,Included
177,Causal Effects of Overall and Abdominal Obesity on Insulin Resistance and the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Study,"Overall and abdominal obesity were significantly associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk in observational studies, though these associations cannot avoid the bias induced by confounding effects and reverse causation. This study aimed to test whether these associations are causal, and it compared the causal effects of overall and abdominal obesity on T2DM risk and glycemic traits by using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design. Based on summary-level statistics from genome-wide association studies, the instrumental variables for body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and WHR adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI) were extracted, and the horizontal pleiotropy was analyzed using MR-Egger regression and the MR-pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (PRESSO) method. Thereafter, by using the conventional MR method, the inverse-variance weighted method was applied to assess the causal effect of BMI, WHR, and WHRadjBMI on T2DM risk, Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), fasting insulin, fasting glucose, and Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). A series of sensitivity analyses, including the multivariable MR (diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as covariates), MR-Egger regression, weighted median, MR-PRESSO, and leave-one-out method, were conducted to test the robustness of the results from the conventional MR. Despite the existence of horizontal pleiotropy, consistent results were found in the conventional MR results and sensitivity analyses, except for the association between BMI and fasting glucose, and WHRadjBMI and fasting glucose. Each one standard deviation higher BMI was associated with an increased T2DM risk [odds ratio (OR): 2.741; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.421-3.104], higher HbA1c [1.054; 1.04-1.068], fasting insulin [1.202; 1.173-1.231], and HOMA-IR [1.221; 1.187-1.255], similar to findings for causal effect of WHRadjBMI on T2DM risk [1.993; 1.704-2.33], HbA1c [1.061; 1.042-1.08], fasting insulin [1.102; 1.068-1.136], and HOMA-IR [1.127; 1.088-1.167]. Both BMI (P = 0.546) and WHRadjBMI (P = 0.443) were unassociated with fasting glucose in the multivariable MR analysis. In conclusion, overall and abdominal obesity have causal effects on T2DM risk and insulin resistance but no causal effect on fasting glucose. Individuals can substantially reduce their insulin resistance and T2DM risk through reduction of body fat mass and modification of body fat distribution.

50,"Causal Factors for Knee, Hip, and Hand Osteoarthritis: A Mendelian Randomization Study in the UK Biobank","OBJECTIVE: There is no curative treatment for osteoarthritis (OA), which is the most common form of arthritis. This study was undertaken to identify causal risk factors of knee, hip, and hand OA., METHODS: Individual-level data from 384,838 unrelated participants in the UK Biobank study were analyzed. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to test for causality for body mass index (BMI), bone mineral density (BMD), serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, type 2 diabetes, systolic blood pressure (BP), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The primary outcome measure was OA determined using hospital diagnoses (all sites, n = 48,431; knee, n = 19,727; hip, n = 11,875; hand, n = 2,330). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated., RESULTS: MR analyses demonstrated a robust causal association of genetically determined BMI with all OA (OR per SD increase 1.57 [95% CI 1.44-1.71]), and with knee OA and hip OA, but not with hand OA. Increased genetically determined femoral neck BMD was causally associated with all OA (OR per SD increase 1.14 [95% CI 1.06-1.22]), knee OA, and hip OA. Low systolic BP was causally associated with all OA (OR per SD decrease 1.55 [95% CI 1.29-1.87]), knee OA, and hip OA. There was no evidence of causality for the other tested metabolic factors or CRP level., CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that BMI exerts a major causal effect on the risk of OA at weight-bearing joints, but not at the hand. Evidence of causality of all OA, knee OA, and hip OA was also observed for high femoral neck BMD and low systolic BP. However, we found no evidence of causality for other metabolic factors or CRP level. Copyright ¬© 2019 The Authors.

13,"Causal Inference for Genetic Obesity, Cardiometabolic Profile and COVID-19 Susceptibility: A Mendelian Randomization Study","BACKGROUND: Cross-sectional observational studies have reported obesity and cardiometabolic co-morbidities as important predictors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalization. The causal impact of these risk factors is unknown at present., METHODS: We conducted multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the observational associations between obesity traits (body mass index [BMI], waist circumference [WC]), quantitative cardiometabolic parameters (systolic blood pressure [SBP], serum glucose, serum glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol and triglycerides [TG]) and SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the UK Biobank cohort. One-sample MR was performed by using the genetic risk scores of obesity and cardiometabolic traits constructed from independent datasets and the genotype and phenotype data from the UK Biobank. Two-sample MR was performed using the summary statistics from COVID-19 host genetics initiative. Cox proportional hazard models were fitted to assess the risk conferred by different genetic quintiles of causative exposure traits., RESULTS: The study comprised 1,211 European participants who were tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 387,079 participants who were either untested or tested negative between 16 March 2020 to 31 May 2020. Observationally, higher BMI, WC, HbA1c and lower HDL-cholesterol were associated with higher odds of COVID-19 infection. One-sample MR analyses found causal associations between higher genetically determined BMI and LDL cholesterol and increased risk of COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR]: 1.15, confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-1.26 and OR: 1.58, CI: 1.21-2.06, per 1 standard deviation increment in BMI and LDL cholesterol respectively). Two-sample MR produced concordant results. Cox models indicated that individuals in the higher genetic risk score quintiles of BMI and LDL were more predisposed to COVID-19 (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.24, CI: 1.03-1.49 and HR: 1.37, CI: 1.14-1.65, for the top vs the bottom quintile for BMI and LDL cholesterol, respectively)., CONCLUSION: We identified causal associations between BMI, LDL cholesterol and susceptibility to COVID-19. In particular, individuals in higher genetic risk categories were predisposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings support the integration of BMI into the risk assessment of COVID-19 and allude to a potential role of lipid modification in the prevention and treatment.

97,Causal association of body mass index with hypertension using a Mendelian randomization design,"Observational studies have shown that obesity is a major risk factor for hypertension, but unmeasured confounding factors may exist. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess the causal effect of obesity on hypertension. The MR analysis was performed in a well-defined community cohort study of 8832 middle-aged (40-69 years) adults in Korea enrolled from 2001 to 2013. We used baseline hypertension and newly diagnosed hypertension during the 10-year follow-up period as the outcome variable. Genetic risk score associated with body mass index (BMI GRS) was used as the instrumental variable (IV) to measure the causal relationship between obesity and hypertension. The IV estimate of causal odds ratio (OR) was derived using the Wald ratio estimator and then exponentiation to express the result as an OR. In the multivariable model adjusting for age, sex, study area, education, smoking, and current alcohol consumption, each 1 kg/m increase in BMI was associated with a 19% (OR: 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-1.21) increase in hypertension risk. We selected 6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (P < 1.0 x 10) associated with BMI by genome-wide screening using linear regression and created 6 types of GRS. We demonstrated that each standard-deviation increase in BMI GRS was associated with a 5% to 6% (OR: 1.05-1.06) increased risk of hypertension (all P < .05). Using BMI GRS as the IV, we found a causal relationship between BMI and hypertension (OR: 1.13-1.26, all P < .05 except weighted GRS [n = 6]). Using Mendelian randomization, we found that obesity is causally associated with hypertension. This information will have important public health implications, supporting evidence that obesity-reduction programs will reduce the incidence of hypertension.",Included,Included
144,Causal associations of body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio with cardiometabolic traits among Chinese children: A Mendelian randomization study,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) have been reported to be causally associated with cardiometabolic diseases in adults in European populations. However, this causality was less explored in East Asian populations and in children. Our study aimed to explore and compare the causal associations of general obesity (measured by BMI) and central obesity (measured by WHR) with cardiometabolic traits., METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis in 2030 unrelated children from two independent case-control studies in Beijing, China. BMI-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and WHR-SNPs identified by previous genome-wide association studies were used as genetic instruments to examine the casual associations of BMI and WHR with cardiometabolic traits, including glycemic traits, blood lipids, and blood pressure. Each 1-SD increase in BMI and WHR were significantly associated with 0.111 mmol/L and 0.110 mmol/L increase in log-transformed fasting insulin (FINS), 0.049 and 0.060 increase in log-transformed HOMA-beta, 0.112 and 0.108 increase in log-transformed HOMA-IR, 0.009 mmol/L and 0.015 mmol/L increase in log-transformed triglyceride, and 15.527 mmHg and 7.277 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure, respectively (all P < 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic curves showed that WHR had a stronger effect on FINS, HOMA-beta, HOMA-IR, and triglyceride than BMI (all P < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Using the MR method, we found that the genetic predisposition to higher BMI or WHR was associated with altered cardiometabolic traits in Chinese children. When compared with general obesity, central obesity might have stronger effects on glycemic traits and blood lipids among children.

10,Causal associations of tobacco smoking with cardiovascular risk factors: a Mendelian randomization analysis of the HUNT Study in Norway,"BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking has been associated with cardiovascular risk factors including adverse serum lipid levels, central obesity and higher resting heart rate, but lower blood pressure and body mass index (BMI). We used a Mendelian randomization approach to study whether these associations may be causal. If smoking affects cardiovascular risk factors then rs1051730 T alleles, predictors of increased smoking quantity, should be associated with cardiovascular risk factors among smokers, but not among never smokers., METHODS: Among 56,625 participants of a population-based study, we estimated associations of rs1051730 T alleles with cardiovascular risk factors and examined whether the associations differed by smoking status., RESULTS: Rs1051730 T alleles were associated with lower BMI and waist and hip circumferences and higher resting heart rate and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and the associations were strongest among current smokers (P interaction 5x10(-9) to 0.01). Rs1051730 T alleles were associated with lower systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure and higher HDL cholesterol concentrations, but these associations did not robustly differ by smoking status. There were no convincing associations of rs1051730 T alleles with waist-hip ratio, diastolic blood pressure and non-fasting serum concentrations of non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose and C-reactive protein., CONCLUSIONS: This Mendelian randomization analysis provides evidence that smoking may cause lower BMI and waist and hip circumferences and higher resting heart rate and eGFR. The findings further suggest that smoking is not a major determinant of waist-hip ratio or adverse blood pressure, serum lipid or glucose levels. Copyright ¬© The Author 2014; all rights reserved.

133,Causal effect of alcohol use on the risk of end-stage kidney disease and related comorbidities: a Mendelian randomization study,"BACKGROUND: An inverse observational association between alcohol use and the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) has been reported. The causal effect of alcohol use on the risk of ESKD warrants additional investigation., METHODS: The study was an observational cohort study investigating the UK Biobank and performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Amounts of alcohol use were collected using a touchscreen questionnaire. In the observational analysis, 212,133 participants without prevalent ESKD were studied, and the association between alcohol use and the risk of prevalent CKD or incident ESKD was investigated. The genetic analysis included 337,138 participants of white British ancestry. For one-sample MR, an analysis based on a polygenic risk score (PRS) was conducted with genetically predicted alcohol intake. The MR analysis investigated ESKD outcome and related comorbidities., RESULTS: Lower alcohol use was observationally associated with a higher risk of prevalent CKD or incident ESKD. However, the genetic risk of CKD was significantly associated with lower alcohol use, suggesting reverse causation. A higher PRS for alcohol use was significantly associated with a higher risk of ESKD (per units of one phenotypical alcohol drink; adjusted odds ratio of 1.16 [95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.31]) and related comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and central obesity., CONCLUSION: The inverse observational association between alcohol use and the risk of CKD or ESKD may have been affected by reverse causation. Our study supports a causal effect of alcohol use on a higher risk of ESKD and related predisposing comorbidities.",Included,Included
68,Causal effects of body mass index on cardiometabolic traits and events: a Mendelian randomization analysis,"Elevated body mass index (BMI) associates with cardiometabolic traits on observational analysis, yet the underlying causal relationships remain unclear. We conducted Mendelian randomization analyses by using a genetic score (GS) comprising 14 BMI-associated SNPs from a recent discovery analysis to investigate the causal role of BMI in cardiometabolic traits and events. We used eight population-based cohorts, including 34,538 European-descent individuals (4,407 type 2 diabetes (T2D), 6,073 coronary heart disease (CHD), and 3,813 stroke cases). A 1 kg/m(2) genetically elevated BMI increased fasting glucose (0.18 mmol/l; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.12-0.24), fasting insulin (8.5%; 95% CI = 5.9-11.1), interleukin-6 (7.0%; 95% CI = 4.0-10.1), and systolic blood pressure (0.70 mmHg; 95% CI = 0.24-1.16) and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.02 mmol/l; 95% CI = -0.03 to -0.01) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; -0.04 mmol/l; 95% CI = -0.07 to -0.01). Observational and causal estimates were directionally concordant, except for LDL-C. A 1 kg/m(2) genetically elevated BMI increased the odds of T2D (odds ratio [OR] = 1.27; 95% CI = 1.18-1.36) but did not alter risk of CHD (OR 1.01; 95% CI = 0.94-1.08) or stroke (OR = 1.03; 95% CI = 0.95-1.12). A meta-analysis incorporating published studies reporting 27,465 CHD events in 219,423 individuals yielded a pooled OR of 1.04 (95% CI = 0.97-1.12) per 1 kg/m(2) increase in BMI. In conclusion, we identified causal effects of BMI on several cardiometabolic traits; however, whether BMI causally impacts CHD risk requires further evidence.

63,Causal effects of cardiovascular risk factors on onset of major age-related diseases: A time-to-event Mendelian randomization study,"BACKGROUNDS: Elucidating the causal effects of common intermediate risk factors on the onset of age-related diseases is indispensable for developing prevention and intervention procedures., METHODS: We conducted two-stage time-to-event Mendelian randomization meta-analyses combining five large-scale longitudinal cohorts to investigate dynamic causal effects of cardiovascular disease risk factors including body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and lipids on the age-at-onset of age-related diseases. We constructed weighted polygenic scores based on genetic markers from previously reported genome-wide association studies as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effects. To avoid false positive due to potential pleiotropic effects of the genetic markers, we performed a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis and an MR-Egger sensitivity analysis that we expanded in the survival context., RESULTS: Our results show that elevated BMI increases the absolute risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) (p=7.68e-04), heart failure (p=9.03e-03), and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (p=1.69e-03) and the causal effects start at different ages. A significant association between BMI and the risk of stroke is observed; however, the sensitivity analyses suggest that the association is attributed to the potential pleiotropic effects of rs2867125 and rs1558902. Raised SBP levels are significantly associated with the development of atrial fibrillation (p=6.42e-03). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are inversely associated with the age-at-onset of T2D (p=1.05e-02). In addition, LDL-C and triglycerides are inversely associated with the risks of cancer and T2D, respectively. Nevertheless, the sensitivity analyses suggest that these associations are probably due to pleiotropic effects of several single-nucleotide polymorphisms including rs4970834 and rs1260326., CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the involvement of BMI in the development of multiple age-related diseases. Some observed causal associations can attribute to pleiotropic effects of some genetic variations. These findings have important implications in unraveling causal effects of common risk factors on age-related diseases and guiding effective intervention strategies to reduce the incidence of these diseases.

167,Causal inference for heritable phenotypic risk factors using heterogeneous genetic instruments,"Over a decade of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have led to the finding of extreme polygenicity of complex traits. The phenomenon that ""all genes affect every complex trait"" complicates Mendelian Randomization (MR) studies, where natural genetic variations are used as instruments to infer the causal effect of heritable risk factors. We reexamine the assumptions of existing MR methods and show how they need to be clarified to allow for pervasive horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneous effect sizes. We propose a comprehensive framework GRAPPLE to analyze the causal effect of target risk factors with heterogeneous genetic instruments and identify possible pleiotropic patterns from data. By using GWAS summary statistics, GRAPPLE can efficiently use both strong and weak genetic instruments, detect the existence of multiple pleiotropic pathways, determine the causal direction and perform multivariable MR to adjust for confounding risk factors. With GRAPPLE, we analyze the effect of blood lipids, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure on 25 disease outcomes, gaining new information on their causal relationships and potential pleiotropic pathways involved.",Included,Included
25,Causal relationships between obesity and the leading causes of death in women and men,"Obesity traits are causally implicated with risk of cardiometabolic diseases. It remains unclear whether there are similar causal effects of obesity traits on other non-communicable diseases. Also, it is largely unexplored whether there are any sex-specific differences in the causal effects of obesity traits on cardiometabolic diseases and other leading causes of death. We constructed sex-specific genetic risk scores (GRS) for three obesity traits; body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and WHR adjusted for BMI, including 565, 324, and 337 genetic variants, respectively. These GRSs were then used as instrumental variables to assess associations between the obesity traits and leading causes of mortality in the UK Biobank using Mendelian randomization. We also investigated associations with potential mediators, including smoking, glycemic and blood pressure traits. Sex-differences were subsequently assessed by Cochran's Q-test (Phet). A Mendelian randomization analysis of 228,466 women and 195,041 men showed that obesity causes coronary artery disease, stroke (particularly ischemic), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, type 2 and 1 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic liver disease, and acute and chronic renal failure. Higher BMI led to higher risk of type 2 diabetes in women than in men (Phet = 1.4x10-5). Waist-hip-ratio led to a higher risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Phet = 3.7x10-6) and higher risk of chronic renal failure (Phet = 1.0x10-4) in men than women. Obesity traits have an etiological role in the majority of the leading global causes of death. Sex differences exist in the effects of obesity traits on risk of type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal failure, which may have downstream implications for public health.",Included,Included

We tested the hypothesis that genetically high coffee intake is associated with low risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, and with related components thereof., METHODS: We included 93,179 individuals from two large general population cohorts in a Mendelian randomization study. We tested first whether high coffee intake is associated with low risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, and with related components thereof, in observational analyses; second, whether five genetic variants near the CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and AHR genes are associated with coffee intake; and third, whether the genetic variants are associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, and with related components thereof. Finally, we tested the genetic association with type 2 diabetes in a meta-analysis including up to 78,021 additional individuals from the DIAGRAM consortium., RESULTS: Observationally, high coffee intake was associated with low risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Further, high coffee intake was associated with high body mass index, waist circumference, weight, height, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides and total cholesterol and with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but not with glucose levels. In genetic analyses, 9-10 vs 0-3 coffee-intake alleles were associated with 29% higher coffee intake. However, genetically derived high coffee intake was not associated convincingly with obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, body mass index, waist circumference, weight, height, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or glucose levels. Per-allele meta-analysed odds ratios for type 2 diabetes were 1.01 (0.98-1.04) for AHR rs4410790, 0.98 (0.95-1.01) for AHR rs6968865, 1.01 (0.99-1.03) for CYP1A1/2 rs2470893, 1.01 (0.98-1.03) for CYP1A1/2 rs2472297 and 0.98 (0.95-1.01) for CYP1A1 rs2472299., CONCLUSIONS: High coffee intake was associated observationally with low risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, and was associated observationally with related components thereof, but with no genetic evidence to support corresponding causal relationships.

BMI, systolic blood pressure, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes showed negative associations with cognitive ability; height was positively associated with cognitive ability. The analyses provided no evidence for casual associations from health to cognitive ability. In the other direction, higher educational attainment predicted lower BMI, systolic blood pressure, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, and taller stature. The analyses indicated no causal association from educational attainment to physical health. The lack of evidence for causal associations between cognitive ability, educational attainment, and physical health could be explained by weak instrumental variables, poorly measured outcomes, or the small number of disease cases.",Included,Included
33,Common quantitative trait locus downstream of RETN gene identified by genome-wide association study is associated with risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Han Chinese: a Mendelian randomization effect,"OBJECTIVE: Plasma resistin level is a potential molecular link between obesity and diabetes. Causal role of resistin, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and genetic variants have not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify quantitative trait loci associated with resistin levels and investigated whether these variants were prospectively associated with the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and T2DM in an independent community-based cohort, the CardioVascular Disease risk FACtors Two-township Study (CVDFACTS)., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped 382 young-onset hypertensive (YOH) subjects with Illumina HumanHap550 chips and searched for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of resistin in the 1(st) stage GWAS and confirmed the finding in another 559 YOH subjects. Logistic regression was used to examine the Mendelian randomization effects between genotypes of confirmed QTLs and metabolic outcomes in 3400 subjects of CVDFACTS., RESULTS: Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (rs3745367 and rs1423096) were significantly associated with resistin levels (p = 5.52 x 10(-15) and p = 2.54 x 10(-20) ) and replicated in another 559 YOH subjects (p = 1.29 x 10(-3) and p = 1.13 x 10(-7) ), respectively. The SNP rs1423096 was further associated with the levels of HDL-C (p = 0.006), the risk of MetS (OR = 2.21, p = 0.0034) and T2DM (OR = 1.62, p = 0.0063) in the CVDFACTS. People with the haplotypes A-G and G-G determined by rs3745367 and rs1423096 showed a significantly increased T2DM risk (p = 0.0068 and p = 0.0035, respectively) compared with those with A-A haplotype., CONCLUSION: We have found that rs3745367 and rs1423096 on the RETN gene were significantly associated with resistin levels. However, rs1423096, downstream of RETN, seems to be associated with MetS and T2DM risk more so than rs3745367.

150,Comorbidities in gout and hyperuricemia: causality or epiphenomena?,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review advances in the understanding of potentially causal relationships between gout, hyperuricemia and comorbidities., RECENT FINDINGS: Observational studies reveal 4-5 comorbidity clusters in gout patients. There tend to be gout alone, gout with chronic kidney disease and gout with other metabolic comorbidities. However, heterogeneous study populations and confounding make inference difficult for causal relationships. Mendelian randomization leverages genetic information as an instrumental variable to indicate putatively causal relationships between traits of epidemiological interest. Thus far, Mendelian randomization has not indicated widespread causal relationships of serum urate for comorbid traits. However, BMI has a small causal effect on serum urate, which may partially explain the increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease among those with gout and hyperuricemia. There is a lack of robust and sufficiently powered Mendelian randomization studies for many serum urate-associated traits, such as hypertension. No adequately powered studies have been completed for gout and its comorbidities., SUMMARY: Although observational studies indicate putative causal effects of serum urate on comorbidities, Mendelian randomization studies suggest that serum urate does not have a causal role on the various tested comorbidities.

189,Comprehensive Investigation of Circulating Biomarkers and Their Causal Role in Atherosclerosis-Related Risk Factors and Clinical Events,"BACKGROUND: Circulating biomarkers have been previously associated with atherosclerosis-related risk factors, but the nature of these associations is incompletely understood., METHODS: We performed multivariable-adjusted regressions and 2-sample Mendelian randomization analyses to assess observational and causal associations of 27 circulating biomarkers with 7 cardiovascular traits in up to 451 933 participants of the UK Biobank., RESULTS: After multiple-testing correction (alpha=1.3x10-4), we found a total of 15, 9, 21, 22, 26, 24, and 26 biomarkers strongly associated with coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, and waist-to-hip ratio; respectively. The Mendelian randomization analyses confirmed strong evidence of previously suggested causal associations for several glucose- and lipid-related biomarkers with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease. Particularly interesting findings included a protective role of IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) in systolic blood pressure, and the strong causal association of lipoprotein(a) in coronary artery disease development (beta, -0.13; per SD change in exposure and outcome and odds ratio, 1.28; P=2.6x10-4 and P=7.4x10-35, respectively). In addition, our results indicated a causal role of increased ALT (alanine aminotransferase) in the development of type 2 diabetes and hypertension (odds ratio, 1.59 and beta, 0.06, per SD change in exposure and outcome; P=4.8x10-11 and P=6.0x10-5). Our results suggest that it is unlikely that CRP (C-reactive protein) and vitamin D play causal roles of any meaningful magnitude in development of cardiometabolic disease., CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed and extended known associations and reported several novel causal associations providing important insights about the cause of these diseases, which can help accelerate new prevention strategies.",Included,Included
82,Contribution of genetics to visceral adiposity and its relation to cardiovascular and metabolic disease,"Visceral adipose tissue (VAT)-fat stored around the internal organs-has been suggested as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic disease1-3, as well as all-cause, cardiovascular-specific and cancer-specific mortality4,5. Yet, the contribution of genetics to VAT, as well as its disease-related effects, are largely unexplored due to the requirement for advanced imaging technologies to accurately measure VAT. Here, we develop sex-stratified, nonlinear prediction models (coefficient of determination = 0.76; typical 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.74-0.78) for VAT mass using the UK Biobank cohort. We performed a genome-wide association study for predicted VAT mass and identified 102 novel visceral adiposity loci. Predicted VAT mass was associated with increased risk of hypertension, heart attack/angina, type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia, and Mendelian randomization analysis showed visceral fat to be a causal risk factor for all four diseases. In particular, a large difference in causal effect between the sexes was found for type 2 diabetes, with an odds ratio of 7.34 (95% CI = 4.48-12.0) in females and an odds ratio of 2.50 (95% CI = 1.98-3.14) in males. Our findings bolster the role of visceral adiposity as a potentially independent risk factor, in particular for type 2 diabetes in Caucasian females. Independent validation in other cohorts is necessary to determine whether the findings can translate to other ethnicities, or outside the UK.",Included,Included
79,Contribution of metabolic risk factors and lifestyle behaviors to cardiovascular disease: A mendelian randomization study,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Etiologic associations between some modifiable factors (metabolic risk factors and lifestyle behaviors) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) remain unclear. To identify targets for CVD prevention, we evaluated the causal associations of these factors with coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic stroke using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) method., METHODS AND RESULTS: Previously published genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for blood pressure (BP), glucose, lipids, overweight, smoking, alcohol intake, sedentariness, and education were used to identify instruments for 15 modifiable factors. We extracted effects of the genetic variants used as instruments for the exposures on coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic stroke from large GWASs (N = 60 801 cases/123 504 controls for CAD and N = 40 585 cases/406 111 controls for ischemic stroke). Genetically predicted hypertension (CAD: OR, 5.19 [95% CI, 4.21-6.41]; ischemic stroke: OR, 4.92 [4.12-5.86]), systolic BP (CAD: OR, 1.03 [1.03-1.04]; ischemic stroke: OR, 1.03 [1.03-1.03]), diastolic BP (CAD: OR, 1.05 [1.05-1.06]; ischemic stroke: OR, 1.05 [1.04-1.05]), type 2 diabetes (CAD: OR, 1.11 [1.08-1.15]; ischemic stroke: OR, 1.07 [1.04-1.10]), smoking initiation (CAD: OR, 1.26 [1.18-1.35]; ischemic stroke: OR, 1.24 [1.16-1.33]), educational attainment (CAD: OR, 0.62 [0.58-0.66]; ischemic stroke: OR, 0.68 [0.63-0.72]), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (CAD: OR, 1.55 [1.41-1.71]), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (CAD: OR, 0.82 [0.74-0.91]), triglycerides (CAD: OR, 1.29 [1.14-1.45]), body mass index (CAD: OR, 1.25 [1.19-1.32]), and alcohol dependence (OR, 1.04 [1.03-1.06]) were causally related to CVD., CONCLUSION: This systematic MR study identified 11 modifiable factors as causal risk factors for CVD, indicating that these factors are important targets for preventing CVD.

72,Conventional and Bidirectional Genetic Evidence on Resting Heart Rate and Cardiometabolic Traits,"CONTEXT: Observational studies have suggested that higher resting heart rate (RHR) may be associated with increased cardiometabolic risk. However, causal associations are not fully understood., OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the direction, strength, and causality of the associations of RHR with cardiometabolic traits., METHODS: We assessed the strength of associations between measured RHR and cardiometabolic traits in 506 211 and 372 452 participants from China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) and UK Biobank (UKB). Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were used to make causal inferences in 99 228 and 371 508 participants from CKB and UKB, respectively., RESULTS: We identified significant directionally concordant observational associations between RHR and higher total cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein, C-reactive protein (CRP), glucose, body mass index, waist-hip ratio (WHR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) after the Bonferroni correction. MR analyses showed that 10 beat/min higher genetically predicted RHR was trans-ethnically associated with a higher DBP (beta 2.059 [95% CI 1.544, 2.574] mmHg in CKB; 2.037 [1.845, 2.229] mmHg in UKB), higher CRP (0.180 [0.057, 0.303] log mg/L in CKB; 0.154 [0.134, 0.174] log mg/L in UKB), higher TG (0.052 [-0.009, 0.113] log mmol/L in CKB; 0.020 [0.010, 0.030] log mmol/L in UKB) and higher WHR (0.218 [-0.033, 0.469] % in CKB; 0.225 [0.111, 0.339] % in UKB). In the opposite direction, higher genetically predicted SBP, TG, glucose, and WHR, and lower high-density lipoprotein, were associated with elevated RHR., CONCLUSION: Our large-scale analyses provide causal evidence for associations between RHR and cardiometabolic traits, highlighting the importance of monitoring heat rate as a means of alleviating the adverse effects of metabolic disorders.

131,Correcting the Standard Errors of 2-Stage Residual Inclusion Estimators for Mendelian Randomization Studies,"Mendelian randomization studies use genotypes as instrumental variables to test for and estimate the causal effects of modifiable risk factors on outcomes. Two-stage residual inclusion (TSRI) estimators have been used when researchers are willing to make parametric assumptions. However, researchers are currently reporting uncorrected or heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors for these estimates. We compared several different forms of the standard error for linear and logistic TSRI estimates in simulations and in real-data examples. Among others, we consider standard errors modified from the approach of Newey (1987), Terza (2016), and bootstrapping. In our simulations Newey, Terza, bootstrap, and corrected 2-stage least squares (in the linear case) standard errors gave the best results in terms of coverage and type I error. In the real-data examples, the Newey standard errors were 0.5% and 2% larger than the unadjusted standard errors for the linear and logistic TSRI estimators, respectively. We show that TSRI estimators with modified standard errors have correct type I error under the null. Researchers should report TSRI estimates with modified standard errors instead of reporting unadjusted or heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors. Copyright ¬© The Author(s) 2017.

41,Deciphering the Plasma Proteome of Type 2 Diabetes,"With an estimated prevalence of 463 million affected, type 2 diabetes represents a major challenge to health care systems worldwide. Analyzing the plasma proteomes of individuals with type 2 diabetes may illuminate hitherto unknown functional mechanisms underlying disease pathology. We assessed the associations between type 2 diabetes and >1,000 plasma proteins in the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) F4 cohort (n = 993, 110 cases), with subsequent replication in the third wave of the Nord-Trondelag Health Study (HUNT3) cohort (n = 940, 149 cases). We computed logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and hypertension. Additionally, we investigated associations with incident type 2 diabetes and performed two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to prioritize our results. Association analysis of prevalent type 2 diabetes revealed 24 replicated proteins, of which 8 are novel. Proteins showing association with incident type 2 diabetes were aminoacylase-1, growth hormone receptor, and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2. Aminoacylase-1 was associated with both prevalent and incident type 2 diabetes. MR analysis yielded nominally significant causal effects of type 2 diabetes on cathepsin Z and rennin, both known to have roles in the pathophysiological pathways of cardiovascular disease, and of sex hormone-binding globulin on type 2 diabetes. In conclusion, our high-throughput proteomics study replicated previously reported type 2 diabetes-protein associations and identified new candidate proteins possibly involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.

146,Detecting and correcting for bias in Mendelian randomization analyses using Gene-by-Environment interactions,"BACKGROUND: Mendelian randomization (MR) has developed into an established method for strengthening causal inference and estimating causal effects, largely due to the proliferation of genome-wide association studies. However, genetic instruments remain controversial, as horizontal pleiotropic effects can introduce bias into causal estimates. Recent work has highlighted the potential of gene-environment interactions in detecting and correcting for pleiotropic bias in MR analyses., METHODS: We introduce MR using Gene-by-Environment interactions (MRGxE) as a framework capable of identifying and correcting for pleiotropic bias. If an instrument-covariate interaction induces variation in the association between a genetic instrument and exposure, it is possible to identify and correct for pleiotropic effects. The interpretation of MRGxE is similar to conventional summary MR approaches, with a particular advantage of MRGxE being the ability to assess the validity of an individual instrument., RESULTS: We investigate the effect of adiposity, measured using body mass index (BMI), upon systolic blood pressure (SBP) using data from the UK Biobank and a single weighted allelic score informed by data from the GIANT consortium. We find MRGxE produces findings in agreement with two-sample summary MR approaches. Further, we perform simulations highlighting the utility of the approach even when the MRGxE assumptions are violated., CONCLUSIONS: By utilizing instrument-covariate interactions in MR analyses implemented within a linear-regression framework, it is possible to identify and correct for horizontal pleiotropic bias, provided the average magnitude of pleiotropy is constant across interaction-covariate subgroups.

20,Diabetes and branched-chain amino acids: What is the link?,"Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) have increasingly been studied as playing a role in diabetes, with the PubMed search string ""diabetes"" AND ""branched chain amino acids"" showing particular growth in studies of the topic over the past decade (Fig. ). In the Young Finn's Study, BCAA and, to a lesser extent, the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine were associated with insulin resistance (IR) in men but not in women, whereas the gluconeogenic amino acids alanine, glutamine, or glycine, and several other amino acids (i.e. histidine, arginine, and tryptophan) did not show an association with IR. Obesity may track more strongly than metabolic syndrome and diabetes with elevated BCAA. In a study of 1302 people aged 40-79; higher levels of BCAA tracked with older age, male sex, and metabolic syndrome, as well as with obesity, cardiovascular risk, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and uric acid. Medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines, by-products of mitochondrial catabolism of BCAAs, as well as branched-chain keto acids and the BCAA themselves distinguished obese people having versus not having features of IR, and in a study of 898 patients with essential hypertension, the BCAA and tyrosine and phenylalanine were associated with metabolic syndrome and impaired fasting glucose. In a meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies, elevations in BCAA and, to a lesser extent, in alanine tracked with IR, whereas higher levels of glutamine and glycine were associated with lesser likelihood of IR. Given these associations with IR, it is not surprising that a number of studies have shown higher BCAA levels in people with and prior to development of type 2 diabetes (T2D), although this has particularly been shown in Caucasian and Asian ethnic groups while not appearing to occur in African Americans. Similarly, higher BCAA levels track with cardiovascular disease. [Figure: see text] The metabolism of BCAA involves two processes: (i) a reversible process catalysed by a branched-chain aminotransferase (BCAT), either cytosolic or mitochondrial, requiring pyridoxal to function as an amino group carrier, by which the BCAA with 2-ketoglutarate produce a branched-chain keto acid plus glutamate; and (ii) the irreversible mitochondrial process catalysed by branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) leading to formation of acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), propionyl-CoA, and 2-methylbutyryl-CoA from leucine, valine, and isoleucine, respectively, which enter the tricarboxylic acid (Krebs) cycle as acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and 2-methylbutyryl-CoA, respectively, leading to ATP formation. The BCAA stimulate secretion of both insulin and glucagon and, when given orally, of both glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), with oral administration leading to greater and more prolonged insulin and glucagon secretion. Insulin may particularly reduce BCAA turnover to a greater extent than that of other amino acids, and decreases the appearance and increases the uptake of amino acids. However, older studies of the effect of glucose or insulin on BCAA concentrations and rates of leucine appearance and oxidation showed no reduction in T2D, although the higher baseline levels of BCAA in obesity have long been recognized. Impaired function of BCAT and BCKDH has been posited, either as a primary genetic abnormality or due to effects of elevated fatty acids, proinflammatory cytokines, or insulin levels with consequent accumulation of branched-chain keto acids and metabolites such as diacylglycerol and ceramide, potentially contributing to the development of further insulin resistance, and decreased skeletal muscle BCAT and BCKDH expression has been shown in people with diabetes, supporting this concept. A Mendelian randomization study used measured variation in genes involved in BCAA metabolism to test the hypothesis of a causal effect of modifiable exposure on IR, showing that variants in protein phosphatase, Mg2+ /Mn2+ dependent 1K (PPM1K), a gene encoding the mitochondrial phosphatase activating the BCKDH complex, are associated with T2D, but another such study suggested that genetic variations associated with IR are causally related to higher BCAA levels. Another hypothesis involves the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which is activated by BCAA, as well as by insulin and glucose via cellular ATP availability. If this is the relevant pathway, BCAA overload may cause insulin resistance by activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), as well as by leading to increases in acylcarnitines, with mTOR seen in this scenario as a central signal of cross-talk between the BCAA and insulin. At this point, whether whole-body or tissue-specific BCAA metabolism is increased or decreased in states of insulin-resistant obesity and T2D is uncertain. Insulin action in the hypothalamus induces but overfeeding decreases hepatic BCKDH, leading to the concept that hypothalamic insulin resistance impairs BCAA metabolism in obesity and diabetes, so that plasma BCAAs may be markers of hypothalamic insulin action rather than direct mediators of changes in IR. A way to address this may be to understand the effects of changes in diet and other interventions on BCAA, as well as on IR and T2D. In an animal model, lowering dietary BCAA increased energy expenditure and improved insulin sensitivity. Two large human population studies showed an association of estimated dietary BCAA intake with T2D risk, although another population study showed higher dietary BCAA to be associated with lower T2D risk. Ethnic differences, reflecting underlying differences in genetic variants, may be responsible for such differences. In the study of Asghari et al. in the current issue of the Journal of Diabetes, BCAA intake was associated with the development of subsequent IR. Studies of bariatric surgery suggest lower basal and post-insulin infusion BCAA levels are associated with greater insulin sensitivity, with reductions in BCAA not seen with weight loss per se with gastric band procedures, but occurring after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, an intervention that may have metabolic benefits over and above those from reduction in body weight. The gut microbiota may be important for the supply of the BCAA to mammalian hosts, either by de novo biosynthesis or by modifying nutrient absorption. A final fascinating preliminary set of observations is that of the effects of empagliflozin on metabolomics; evidence of increased Krebs cycle activation and of higher levels of BCAA metabolites, such as acylcarnitines, suggests that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition may, to some extent, involve BCAA metabolism. Certainly, we do not yet have a full understanding of these complex associations. However, the suggestion of multiple roles of BCAA in the development of IR promises to be important and to lead to the development of novel effective T2D therapies.

114,Disease consequences of higher adiposity uncoupled from its adverse metabolic effects using Mendelian randomisation,"Background: Some individuals living with obesity may be relatively metabolically healthy, whilst others suffer from multiple conditions that may be linked to adverse metabolic effects or other factors. The extent to which the adverse metabolic component of obesity contributes to disease compared to the non-metabolic components is often uncertain. We aimed to use Mendelian randomisation (MR) and specific genetic variants to separately test the causal roles of higher adiposity with and without its adverse metabolic effects on diseases., Methods: We selected 37 chronic diseases associated with obesity and genetic variants associated with different aspects of excess weight. These genetic variants included those associated with metabolically 'favourable adiposity' (FA) and 'unfavourable adiposity' (UFA) that are both associated with higher adiposity but with opposite effects on metabolic risk. We used these variants and two sample MR to test the effects on the chronic diseases., Results: MR identified two sets of diseases. First, 11 conditions where the metabolic effect of higher adiposity is the likely primary cause of the disease. Here, MR with the FA and UFA genetics showed opposing effects on risk of disease: coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, hypertension, stroke, type 2 diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, renal cancer, and gout. Second, 9 conditions where the non-metabolic effects of excess weight (e.g. mechanical effect) are likely a cause. Here, MR with the FA genetics, despite leading to lower metabolic risk, and MR with the UFA genetics, both indicated higher disease risk: osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, gallstones, adult-onset asthma, psoriasis, deep vein thrombosis, and venous thromboembolism., Conclusions: Our results assist in understanding the consequences of higher adiposity uncoupled from its adverse metabolic effects, including the risks to individuals with high body mass index who may be relatively metabolically healthy., Funding: Diabetes UK, UK Medical Research Council, World Cancer Research Fund, National Cancer Institute.

49,Distinct causal effects of body fat distribution on cardiometabolic traits among children: Findings from the BCAMS study,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Observational studies reveal that different body fat measures are associated with cardiometabolic disease with different effects. However, causality is not reflected by such observations. To explore and compare the causal relationships of general obesity (measured by body mass index (BMI)), adipose obesity (measured by fat mass percentage (FMP)) and central obesity (measured by waist-to-height ratio (WHtR)) with cardiometabolic traits among children., METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted one sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis in 3266 children from Beijing Children and Adolescents Metabolic Syndrome Study. Genetic instruments based on 28 SNPs were performed to explore and compare the causal associations of genetically BMI, FMP and WHtR with cardiometabolic traits. The genetic instruments were robustly correlated with observed BMI, FMP and WHtR. Each genetically 1-SD increment in BMI, FMP and WHtR were causally associated with increment in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), log-transformed fasting plasma glucose (FPG), log-transformed HOMA-beta, and decrease in log-transformed high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), respectively (all P < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction). The receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that BMI and FMP showed stronger effects on SBP, DBP, HOMA-beta and HDL than WHtR (all P < 0.05). We also observed causal associations of BMI and FMP with log-transformed fasting insulin and HOMA-IR., CONCLUSIONS: The MR analysis based on population-based cohort indicated a causal relationship of adiposity and body fat distribution with cardiometabolic traits. When compared with central obesity, general obesity and adipose obesity might own stronger effects on blood pressure and blood lipids among children. Copyright ¬© 2022.

157,Does greater adiposity increase blood pressure and hypertension risk?: Mendelian randomization using the FTO/MC4R genotype,"Elevated blood pressure increases the risk of experiencing cardiovascular events like myocardial infarction and stroke. Current observational data suggest that body mass index may have a causal role in the etiology of hypertension, but this may be influenced by confounding and reverse causation. Through the use of instrumental variable methods, we aim to estimate the strength of the unconfounded and unbiased association between body mass index/adiposity and blood pressure. We explore these issues in the Copenhagen General Population Study. We used instrumental variable methods to obtain estimates of the causal association between body mass index and blood pressure. This was performed using both rs9939609 (FTO) and rs17782313 (MC4R) genotypes as instruments for body mass index. Avoiding the epidemiological problems of confounding, bias, and reverse causation, we confirmed observational associations between body mass index and blood pressure. In analyses including those taking antihypertensive drugs, but for whom appropriate adjustment had been made, systolic blood pressure was seen to increase by 3.85 mm Hg (95% CI: 1.88 to 5.83 mm Hg) for each 10% increase in body mass index (P=0.0002), with diastolic blood pressure showing an increase of 1.79 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.68 to 2.90 mm Hg) for each 10% increase in body mass index (P=0.002). Observed associations are large and illustrate the considerable benefits in terms of reductions in blood pressure-related morbidity that could be achieved through a reduction in body mass index.",Included,Included
85,Does high C-reactive protein concentration increase atherosclerosis? The Whitehall II Study,"BACKGROUND: C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation, is associated with risk of coronary events and sub-clinical measures of atherosclerosis. Evidence in support of this link being causal would include an association robust to adjustments for confounders (multivariable standard regression analysis) and the association of CRP gene polymorphisms with atherosclerosis (Mendelian randomization analysis)., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We genotyped 3 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [+1444T>C (rs1130864); +2303G>A (rs1205) and +4899T>G (rs 3093077)] in the CRP gene and assessed CRP and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), a structural marker of atherosclerosis, in 4941 men and women aged 50-74 (mean 61) years (the Whitehall II Study). The 4 major haplotypes from the SNPs were consistently associated with CRP level, but not with other risk factors that might confound the association between CRP and CIMT. CRP, assessed both at mean age 49 and at mean age 61, was associated both with CIMT in age and sex adjusted standard regression analyses and with potential confounding factors. However, the association of CRP with CIMT attenuated to the null with adjustment for confounding factors in both prospective and cross-sectional analyses. When examined using genetic variants as the instrument for serum CRP, there was no inferred association between CRP and CIMT., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Both multivariable standard regression analysis and Mendelian randomization analysis suggest that the association of CRP with carotid atheroma indexed by CIMT may not be causal.",Included,Included
126,Duration of obesity exposure between ages 10 and 40 years and its relationship with cardiometabolic disease risk factors: A cohort study,"BACKGROUND: Individuals with obesity do not represent a homogeneous group in terms of cardiometabolic risk. Using 3 nationally representative British birth cohorts, we investigated whether the duration of obesity was related to heterogeneity in cardiometabolic risk., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used harmonised body mass index (BMI) and cardiometabolic disease risk factor data from 20,746 participants (49.1% male and 97.2% white British) enrolled in 3 British birth cohort studies: the 1946 National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD), the 1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS), and the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70). Within each cohort, individual life course BMI trajectories were created between 10 and 40 years of age, and from these, age of obesity onset, duration spent obese (range 0 to 30 years), and cumulative obesity severity were derived. Obesity duration was examined in relation to a number of cardiometabolic disease risk factors collected in mid-adulthood: systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). A greater obesity duration was associated with worse values for all cardiometabolic disease risk factors. The strongest association with obesity duration was for HbA1c: HbA1c levels in those with obesity for <5 years were relatively higher by 5% (95% CI: 4, 6), compared with never obese, increasing to 20% (95% CI: 17, 23) higher in those with obesity for 20 to 30 years. When adjustment was made for obesity severity, the association with obesity duration was largely attenuated for SBP, DBP, and HDL-C. For HbA1c, however, the association with obesity duration persisted, independent of obesity severity. Due to pooling of 3 cohorts and thus the availability of only a limited number harmonised variables across cohorts, our models included adjustment for only a small number of potential confounding variables, meaning there is a possibility of residual confounding., CONCLUSIONS: Given that the obesity epidemic is characterised by a much earlier onset of obesity and consequently a greater lifetime exposure, our findings suggest that health policy recommendations aimed at preventing early obesity onset, and therefore reducing lifetime exposure, may help reduce the risk of diabetes, independently of obesity severity. However, to test the robustness of our observed associations, triangulation of evidence from different epidemiological approaches (e.g., mendelian randomization and negative control studies) should be obtained.",Excluded,Excluded

The effect estimates were calculated using the random-effects inverse-variance-weighted method., RESULTS: Cheese intake per standard deviation increase causally reduced the risks of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio (OR) = 0.46; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.34-0.63; p = 1.02 x 10-6), heart failure (OR = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.49-0.79; p = 0.0001), coronary heart disease (OR = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53-0.79; p = 2.01 x 10-5), hypertension (OR = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.53-0.84; p = 0.001), and ischemic stroke (OR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63-0.91; p = 0.003). Suggestive evidence of an inverse association between cheese intake and peripheral artery disease was also observed. No associations were observed for atrial fibrillation, cardiac death, pulmonary embolism, or transient ischemic attack. The better prognosis associated with cheese intake may be explained by lower body mass index (BMI; effect estimate = -0.58; 95% CI, from -0.88 to -0.27; p = 0.0002), waist circumference (effect estimate = -0.49; 95% CI, from -0.76 to -0.23; p = 0.0003), triglycerides (effect estimate = -0.33; 95% CI, from -0.50 to -0.17; p = 4.91 x 10-5), and fasting glucose (effect estimate = -0.20; 95% CI, from -0.33 to -0.07; p = 0.0003). There was suggestive evidence of a positive association between cheese intake and high-density lipoprotein. No influences were observed for blood pressure or inflammation biomarkers., CONCLUSIONS: This two-sample MR analysis found causally inverse associations between cheese intake and type 2 diabetes, heart failure, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and ischemic stroke.",Included,Included
64,Effect of Systolic Blood Pressure on Left Ventricular Structure and Function: A Mendelian Randomization Study,"We aimed to estimate the effects of a lifelong exposure to high systolic blood pressure (SBP) on left ventricular (LV) structure and function using Mendelian randomization. A total of 5596 participants of the UK Biobank were included for whom cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging and genetic data were available. Major exclusion criteria included nonwhite ethnicity, major cardiovascular disease, and body mass index >30 or <18.5 kg/m2. A genetic risk score to estimate genetically predicted SBP (gSBP) was constructed based on 107 previously established genetic variants. Manual cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging postprocessing analyses were performed in 300 individuals at the extremes of gSBP (150 highest and lowest). Multivariable linear regression analyses of imaging biomarkers were performed using gSBP as continuous independent variable. All analyses except myocardial strain were validated using previously derived imaging parameters in 2530 subjects. The mean (SD) age of the study population was 62 (7) years, and 52% of subjects were female. Corrected for age, sex, and body surface area, each 10 mm Hg increase in gSBP was significantly (P<0.0056) associated with 4.01 g (SE, 1.28; P=0.002) increase in LV mass and with 2.80% (SE, 0.97; P=0.004) increase in LV global radial strain. In the validation cohort, after correction for age, sex, and body surface area, each 10 mm Hg increase in gSBP was associated with 5.27 g (SE, 1.50; P<0.001) increase in LV mass. Our study provides a novel line of evidence for a causal relationship between SBP and increased LV mass and with increased LV global radial strain.",Included,Included
28,Effects of the Timing of Sex-Steroid Exposure in Adolescence on Adult Health Outcomes,"CONTEXT: Variation in pubertal timing is associated with a wide range of adult risks and outcomes, but it is unclear whether these associations are causal, and it is largely unknown whether these associations can be modified by treatment., EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We conducted PubMed searches to identify Mendelian randomization (MR) studies on the influence of pubertal timing on adult health and studies on sex-steroid treatment of the following conditions associated with reduced reproductive endocrine function in adolescence: constitutional delay, Turner syndrome, and Klinefelter syndrome., EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Results of MR studies suggest that earlier pubertal timing increases body mass index; increases risk for breast, ovarian, endometrial, and prostate cancers; elevates fasting glucose levels and blood pressure; impairs lung capacity and increases risk for asthma; leads to earlier sexual intercourse and first birth; decreases time spent in education; and increases depressive symptoms in adolescence. Later pubertal timing appears to lower bone mineral density (BMD). Although studies of constitutional delay have not shown that sex-steroid treatment alters adult height or BMD, studies of girls with Turner syndrome and boys with Klinefelter syndrome suggest that earlier initiation of sex-steroid treatment improves physical and neurocognitive outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: Despite having some limitations, MR studies suggest that pubertal timing causally influences many adult conditions and disease risks. Studies of Turner syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome suggest that earlier sex-steroid exposure may have short- and long-term benefits. The mechanisms underlying these findings and the effects of trends and treatments affecting pubertal timing remain to be determined. Copyright ¬© 2019 Endocrine Society.",Included,Included
83,Epigenetic loci for blood pressure are associated with hypertensive target organ damage in older African Americans from the genetic epidemiology network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) study,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a major modifiable risk factor for arteriosclerosis that can lead to target organ damage (TOD) of heart, kidneys, and peripheral arteries. A recent epigenome-wide association study for blood pressure (BP) identified 13 CpG sites, but it is not known whether DNA methylation at these sites is also associated with TOD., METHODS: In 1218 African Americans from the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) study, a cohort of hypertensive sibships, we evaluated the associations between methylation at these 13 CpG sites measured in peripheral blood leukocytes and five TOD traits assessed approximately 5 years later., RESULTS: Ten significant associations were found after adjustment for age, sex, blood cell counts, time difference between CpG and TOD measurement, and 10 genetic principal components (FDR q < 0.1): two with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, cg06690548, cg10601624), six with urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR, cg16246545, cg14476101, cg19693031, cg06690548, cg00574958, cg22304262), and two with left ventricular mass indexed to height (LVMI, cg19693031, cg00574958). All associations with eGFR and four associations with UACR remained significant after further adjustment for body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and diabetes. We also found significant interactions between cg06690548 and BMI on UACR, and between 3 CpG sites (cg19693031, cg14476101, and cg06690548) and diabetes on UACR (FDR q < 0.1). Mediation analysis showed that 4.7% to 38.1% of the relationship between two CpG sites (cg19693031 and cg00574958) and two TOD measures (UACR and LVMI) was mediated by blood pressure (Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05). Mendelian randomization analysis suggests that methylation at two sites (cg16246545 and cg14476101) in PHGDH may causally influence UACR., CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we found compelling evidence for associations between arteriosclerotic traits of kidney and heart and previously identified blood pressure-associated DNA methylation sites. This study may lend insight into the role of DNA methylation in pathological mechanisms underlying target organ damage from hypertension.",Excluded,Excluded
6,Epigenome-wide association study identifies DNA methylation sites associated with target organ damage in older African Americans,"Target organ damage (TOD) manifests as vascular injuries in the body organ systems associated with long-standing hypertension. DNA methylation in peripheral blood leukocytes can capture inflammatory processes and gene expression changes underlying TOD. We investigated the association between epigenome-wide DNA methylation and five measures of TOD (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR), left ventricular mass index (LVMI), relative wall thickness (RWT), and white matter hyperintensity (WMH)) in 961 African Americans from hypertensive sibships. A multivariate (multi-trait) model of eGFR, UACR, LVMI, and RWT identified seven CpGs associated with at least one of the traits (cg21134922, cg04816311 near C7orf50, cg09155024, cg10254690 near OAT, cg07660512, cg12661888 near IFT43, and cg02264946 near CATSPERD) at FDR q < 0.1. Adjusting for blood pressure, body mass index, and type 2 diabetes attenuated the association for four CpGs. DNA methylation was associated with cis-gene expression for some CpGs, but no significant mediation by gene expression was detected. Mendelian randomization analyses suggested causality between three CpGs and eGFR (cg04816311, cg10254690, and cg07660512). We also assessed whether the identified CpGs were associated with TOD in 614 African Americans in the Hypertension Genetic Epidemiology Network (HyperGEN) study. Out of three CpGs available for replication, cg04816311 was significantly associated with eGFR (p = 0.0003), LVMI (p = 0.0003), and RWT (p = 0.002). This study found evidence of an association between DNA methylation and TOD in African Americans and highlights the utility of using a multivariate-based model that leverages information across related traits in epigenome-wide association studies.",Excluded,Excluded
175,Evaluation of the causal effects between subjective wellbeing and cardiometabolic health: mendelian randomisation study,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether the association between subjective wellbeing (subjective happiness and life satisfaction) and cardiometabolic health is causal., DESIGN: Two sample, bidirectional mendelian randomisation study., SETTING: Genetic data taken from various cohorts comprised of the general population (mostly individuals of European ancestry, plus a small proportion of other ancestries); follow-up analysis included individuals from the United Kingdom., PARTICIPANTS: Summary data were used from previous genome wide association studies (number of participants ranging from 83 198 to 339 224), which investigated traits related to cardiovascular or metabolic health, had the largest sample sizes, and consisted of the most similar populations while minimising sample overlap. A follow-up analysis included 337 112 individuals from the UK Biobank (54% female (n=181 363), mean age 56.87 years (standard deviation 8.00) at recruitment)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subjective wellbeing and 11 measures of cardiometabolic health (coronary artery disease; myocardial infarction; total, high density lipoprotein, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol; diastolic and systolic blood pressure; body fat; waist to hip ratio; waist circumference; and body mass index)., RESULTS: Evidence of a causal effect of body mass index on subjective wellbeing was seen; each 1 kg/m2 increase in body mass index caused a -0.045 (95% confidence interval -0.084 to -0.006, P=0.02) standard deviation reduction in subjective wellbeing. Follow-up analysis of this association in an independent sample from the UK Biobank provided strong evidence of an effect of body mass index on satisfaction with health (beta=-0.035 unit decrease in health satisfaction (95% confidence interval -0.043 to -0.027) per standard deviation increase in body mass index, P<0.001). No clear evidence of a causal effect was seen between subjective wellbeing and the other cardiometabolic health measures, in either direction., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a higher body mass index is associated with a lower subjective wellbeing. A follow-up analysis confirmed this finding, suggesting that the effect in middle aged people could be driven by satisfaction with health. Body mass index is a modifiable determinant, and therefore, this study provides further motivation to tackle the obesity epidemic because of the knock-on effects of higher body mass index on subjective wellbeing.

129,Evidence of a causal relationship between high serum adiponectin levels and increased cardiovascular mortality rate in patients with type 2 diabetes,"BACKGROUND: Despite its beneficial role on insulin resistance and atherosclerosis, adiponectin has been repeatedly reported as an independent positive predictor of cardiovascular mortality., METHODS: A Mendelian randomization approach was used, in order to evaluate whether such counterintuitive association recognizes a cause-effect relationship. To this purpose, single nucleotide polymorphism rs822354 in the ADIPOQ locus which has been previously associated with serum adiponectin at genome-wide level, was used as an instrument variable. Our investigation was carried out in the Gargano Heart Study-prospective design, comprising 356 patients with type 2 diabetes, in whom both total and high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin were measured and cardiovascular mortality was recorded (mean follow-up = 5.4 +/- 2.5 years; 58 events/1922 person-year)., RESULTS: The A allele of rs822354 was associated with both total and HMW adiponectin [beta (SE) = 0.10 (0.042), p = 0.014 and 0.17 (0.06), p = 0.003; respectively]. In a Poisson model comprising age, sex, smoking habits, BMI, HbA1c, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin therapy and hypertension, both rs822354 (IRR = 1.94, 95 % CI 1.23-3.07; p = 0.005), as well as the genetic equivalent of total adiponectin change (IRR = 1.07, 95 % CI 1.02-1.12; p = 0.003) were significantly associated with cardiovascular mortality. The observed genetic effect was significantly greater than that exerted by the genetic equivalent change of serum adiponectin (p for IRR heterogeneity = 0.012). In the above-mentioned adjusted model, very similar results were obtained when HMW, rather than total, adiponectin was used as the exposure variable of interest., CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the paradoxical association between high serum adiponectin levels and increased cardiovascular mortality rate is based on a cause-effect relationship, thus pointing to an unexpected deleterious role of adiponectin action/metabolism on atherosclerotic processes.",Included,Included
32,Excess comorbidities in gout: the causal paradigm and pleiotropic approaches to care,"Gout is a common hyperuricaemic metabolic condition that leads to painful inflammatory arthritis and a high comorbidity burden, especially cardiometabolic-renal (CMR) conditions, including hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, obesity, hyperlipidaemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. Substantial advances have been made in our understanding of the excess CMR burden in gout, ranging from pathogenesis underlying excess CMR comorbidities, inferring causal relationships from Mendelian randomization studies, and potentially discovering urate crystals in coronary arteries using advanced imaging, to clinical trials and observational studies. Despite many studies finding an independent association between blood urate levels and risk of incident CMR events, Mendelian randomization studies have largely found that serum urate is not causal for CMR end points or intermediate risk factors or outcomes (such as kidney function, adiposity, metabolic syndrome, glycaemic traits or blood lipid concentrations). Although limited, randomized controlled trials to date in adults without gout support this conclusion. If imaging studies suggesting that monosodium urate crystals are deposited in coronary plaques in patients with gout are confirmed, it is possible that these crystals might have a role in the inflammatory pathogenesis of increased cardiovascular risk in patients with gout; removing monosodium urate crystals or blocking the inflammatory pathway could reduce this excess risk. Accordingly, data for CMR outcomes with these urate-lowering or anti-inflammatory therapies in patients with gout are needed. In the meantime, highly pleiotropic CMR and urate-lowering benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and key lifestyle measures could play an important role in comorbidity care, in conjunction with effective gout care based on target serum urate concentrations according to the latest guidelines.

3,Excessive alcohol consumption increases mortality in later life: a genetic analysis of the health in men cohort study,"We designed this cohort study of men aged 70-89 years to determine if excessive alcohol use increases mortality. They reported history of alcohol use (never, past, <= two daily drinks, two to four daily drinks, four to six daily drinks, > six daily drinks) and donated a blood sample in 2001-2004. We determined the ADH1B rs1229984 G>A polymorphism and retrieved mortality data from the Western Australian Data Linkage System. Other study measures included age, education, body mass index, smoking, and history of hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, coronary heart disease and stroke. Of the 3496 participants, 225 (6.4 percent) carried the ADH1B rs1229984 G>A polymorphism. Carriers consumed significantly less alcohol than non-carriers. The adjusted mortality hazard ratio (MHR, 95 percent confidence interval-95%CI) over 8.0 years (range: 10 weeks to 11.2 years) relative to never drinkers was 1.15 (95%CI = 0.86, 1.55) for past drinkers, 0.98 (95%CI = 0.76, 1.25) for men consuming <= two daily drinks, 1.13 (95%CI = 0.85, 1.49) for two to four drinks, 1.18 (95%CI = 0.81, 1.71) for four to six drinks and 1.87 (95%CI = 1.11, 3.12) for those consuming more than six daily drinks on a regular basis. The MHR associated with the ADH1B rs1229984 G>A polymorphism was 0.68 (95%CI = 0.54, 0.87). Excessive alcohol use in later life is associated with increased mortality, and this association is likely to be causal. We found no evidence that light to moderate alcohol use decreases the mortality of older men. Health messages regarding the safe use of alcohol in older age may benefit from taking these findings into account. Copyright ¬© 2015 Society for the Study of Addiction.",Included,Included
96,Exploring causal associations between alcohol and coronary heart disease risk factors: findings from a Mendelian randomization study in the Copenhagen General Population Study,"AIMS: To explore the causal effect of long-term alcohol consumption on coronary heart disease risk factors., METHODS AND RESULTS: We used variants in ADH1B and ADH1C genes as instrumental variables (IV) to estimate the causal effect of long-term alcohol consumption on body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), lipids, fibrinogen, and glucose. Analyses were undertaken in 54 604 Danes (mean age 56 years). Both confounder-adjusted multivariable and IV analyses suggested that a greater alcohol consumption among those who drank any alcohol resulted in a higher BP [mean difference in SBP per doubling of alcohol consumption among drinkers: 0.76 mmHg (95% CI: 0.63, 0.90) from multivariable analyses and 0.94 mmHg (-3.03, 4.69) from IV analyses; P-value for difference in these results = 0.95]. The positive association of alcohol with HDLc in the multivariable analyses [4.9% (4.7, 5.1)] appeared stronger than in the IV analyses [1.5% (-4.5, 7.4)], and the weak inverse association with fibrinogen in the multivariable analysis [-2.0% (-2.1, -1.8)] was not present in the IV analyses [0.6% (-3.8, 5.0)], but statistically the results for both of these could not be reliably distinguished from each other (P-values 0.21 and 0.32, respectively). The weak inverse association of alcohol with BMI [-0.13 kg/m(2) (-0.16, -0.10)] and with triglycerides [-0.4% (-0.7, 0.4)] in multivariable analyses were in contrast to the strong positive association of alcohol with BMI [1.37 kg/m(2) (0.59, 2.15)] and the strong inverse association with triglycerides [-14.9% (-25.6, -4.3)] in IV analyses; P = 0.006 and 0.01, respectively, for difference between the two. Alcohol was not associated with non-HDLc or glucose., CONCLUSION: Our results show adverse effects of long-term alcohol consumption on BP and BMI. We also found novel evidence for a potentially beneficial effect on triglyceride levels, which needs further replication.",Included,Included
164,Exploring the Relationship Between Schizophrenia and Cardiovascular Disease: A Genetic Correlation and Multivariable Mendelian Randomization Study,"Individuals with schizophrenia have a reduced life-expectancy compared to the general population, largely due to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Clinical and epidemiological studies have been unable to unravel the nature of this relationship. We obtained summary-data of genome-wide-association studies of schizophrenia (N = 130 644), heart failure (N = 977 323), coronary artery disease (N = 332 477), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (N = 757 601), heart rate variability (N = 46 952), QT interval (N = 103 331), early repolarization and dilated cardiomyopathy ECG patterns (N = 63 700). We computed genetic correlations and conducted bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess causality. With multivariable MR, we investigated whether causal effects were mediated by smoking, body mass index, physical activity, lipid levels, or type 2 diabetes. Genetic correlations between schizophrenia and CVD were close to zero (-0.02-0.04). There was evidence that liability to schizophrenia causally increases heart failure risk. This effect remained consistent with multivariable MR. There was also evidence that liability to schizophrenia increases early repolarization pattern, largely mediated by BMI and lipids. Finally, there was evidence that liability to schizophrenia increases heart rate variability, a direction of effect contrasting clinical studies. There was weak evidence that higher systolic blood pressure increases schizophrenia risk. Our finding that liability to schizophrenia increases heart failure is consistent with the notion that schizophrenia involves a systemic dysregulation of the body with detrimental effects on the heart. To decrease cardiovascular mortality among individuals with schizophrenia, priority should lie with optimal treatment in early stages of psychosis. Copyright ¬© The Author(s) 2021.

69,Exploring the causal pathway from ischemic stroke to atrial fibrillation: a network Mendelian randomization study,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies have found ischemic stroke is associated with atrial fibrillation. However, the causal association between ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation is not clear. Furthermore, the network relationship among ischemic stroke, atrial fibrillation and its risk factors need further attention. This study aims to examine the potential causal association between ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation and further to explore potential mediators in the causal pathway from ischemic stroke to atrial fibrillation., METHODS: Summary statistics from the ISGC (case = 10,307 and control = 19,326) were used as ischemic stroke genetic instruments, AFGen Consortium data (case = 65,446 and control = 522,744) were used for atrial fibrillation, and other consortia data were used for potential mediators (fasting insulin, white blood cell count, procalcitonin, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, and height). Under the framework of network Mendelian randomization, two-sample Mendelian randomization study was performed using summary statistics from several genome-wide association studies. Inverse-variance weighted method was performed to estimate causal effect., RESULTS: Blood pressure mediates the causal pathways from ischemic stroke to atrial fibrillation. The total odds ratio of ischemic stroke on atrial fibrillation was 1.05 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.07; P = 1.3 x 10-5). One-unit increase of genetically determined ischemic stroke was associated with 0.02 (DBP: 95% CI, 0.001 to 0.034, P = 0.029; SBP: 95% CI, 0.006 to 0.034, P = 0.003) upper systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels. Higher genetically determined systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels were associated with higher atrial fibrillation risk (DBP: RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.35; P = 0.012. SBP: RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.38; P = 0.04). Specially, we also found the bidirectional causality between blood pressure and ischemic stroke., CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided a strong evidence that raised blood pressure in stroke patients increases the risk of atrial fibrillation and active acute blood pressure lowering can improve the outcome in ischemic stroke patients.",Included,Included
4,Exploring the relationship between maternal iron status and offspring's blood pressure and adiposity: a Mendelian randomization study,"BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency worldwide. Experimental animal studies suggest that mothers deficient in iron during pregnancy are more likely to have offspring who become obese with high blood pressure. C282Y mutation carriers are more likely to have higher iron stores., METHODS: We undertook an instrumental variable (IV) analysis, using maternal C282Y as an indicator for the mother's iron status, to examine its association with offspring blood pressure (BP), waist circumference (WC), and body mass index (BMI), and compared the results to that of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. Offspring of a sub-cohort of mothers from the UK Women's Cohort Study (UKWCS) were recruited in 2009-2010 (n = 348, mean age = 41 years). Their blood pressure, height, and weight were measured at their local general medical practice, and they were asked to self-measure their waist circumference. About half were offspring of C282Y carriers. Maternal ferritin was used as a biomarker of maternal iron status., RESULTS: Maternal C282Y was strongly associated with maternal ferritin (mean difference per allele = 84 g/L, 95% confidence interval: 31-137, P = 0.002). Using IV analyses, maternal ferritin was not linked to offspring's BP, BMI, or WC. The first stage F-statistic for the strength of the instrument was 10 (Kleibergen-Paap rk LM P = 0.009). Maternal ferritin was linked to offspring diastolic BP, WC, and BMI in univariable, but not in multivariable OLS analysis. There was no difference between the OLS and the IV models coefficients for any of the outcomes considered., CONCLUSION: We found no association between maternal iron status and adult offspring's BP and adiposity using both multivariable OLS and IV modeling. To our knowledge, this is the first study examining this relationship. Further exploration in larger studies that have genetic variation assessed in both mother and offspring should be considered.",Excluded,Excluded
138,Factorial Mendelian randomization: using genetic variants to assess interactions,"BACKGROUND: Factorial Mendelian randomization is the use of genetic variants to answer questions about interactions. Although the approach has been used in applied investigations, little methodological advice is available on how to design or perform a factorial Mendelian randomization analysis. Previous analyses have employed a 2 x 2 approach, using dichotomized genetic scores to divide the population into four subgroups as in a factorial randomized trial., METHODS: We describe two distinct contexts for factorial Mendelian randomization: investigating interactions between risk factors, and investigating interactions between pharmacological interventions on risk factors. We propose two-stage least squares methods using all available genetic variants and their interactions as instrumental variables, and using continuous genetic scores as instrumental variables rather than dichotomized scores. We illustrate our methods using data from UK Biobank to investigate the interaction between body mass index and alcohol consumption on systolic blood pressure., RESULTS: Simulated and real data show that efficiency is maximized using the full set of interactions between genetic variants as instruments. In the applied example, between 4- and 10-fold improvement in efficiency is demonstrated over the 2 x 2 approach. Analyses using continuous genetic scores are more efficient than those using dichotomized scores. Efficiency is improved by finding genetic variants that divide the population at a natural break in the distribution of the risk factor, or else divide the population into more equal-sized groups., CONCLUSIONS: Previous factorial Mendelian randomization analyses may have been underpowered. Efficiency can be improved by using all genetic variants and their interactions as instrumental variables, rather than the 2 x 2 approach. Copyright ¬© The Author(s) 2019.

A risk-based approach to preoperative medical evaluation may allow surgeons to provide high-value patient care., OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of a risk-based approach to cataract surgery preoperative medical evaluation through a lens of safety and throughput., DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A pilot study was performed to evaluate the implementation of a risk-based approach to preoperative medical evaluation for cataract surgery using a virtual medical history questionnaire. The intervention group, seen from June to September 2020, received the risk assessment and those who were low risk proceeded to surgery without further preoperative evaluation prior to the day of surgery. The preintervention control group included patients who received standard care from January to December 2019., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes included rates of intraoperative complications, noneye-related emergency department visits within 7 days, inpatient admissions within 7 days of surgery, case delays, and rates of case cancellation. The secondary outcome included patient perception regarding preoperative care., RESULTS: A total of 1095 patients undergoing cataract surgery were included in the intervention group (1813 [58.2%] female) and 3114 were in the control group (621/1095 [56.7%] female). The mean (SD) age was 68.6 (11.0) in the control group and 68.4 (10.5) in the intervention group. The intervention group included 126 low-risk individuals (11.5%) and 969 individuals who received standard care (88.5%). There were no differences between the control and intervention groups in terms of rates of intraoperative complications (control group vs intervention group: 21 [0.7%] vs 3 [0.3%]; difference, -0.4% [95% CI, -0.82 to 0.02]), 7-day noneye-related ED visits (5 [0.2%] vs 3 [0.3%]; difference, 0.1% [95% CI, -0.23 to 0.45]), 7-day inpatient admissions (6 [0.2%] vs 2 [0.2%]; difference, -0.01% [95% CI, -0.31 to 0.29]), or same-day cancellations (31 [0.8%] vs 10 [0.6%]; difference, -0.15% [95% CI, -0.63 to 0.34]). The control group had more case delays (59 [1.9%] vs 7 [0.6%]; difference, -1.3% [95% CI, -1.93 to -0.58])., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that a virtual, risk-based approach to preoperative medical evaluations for cataract surgery is associated with safe and efficient outcomes. These findings may encourage health care systems and ambulatory surgery centers to tailor preoperative requirements for low-risk surgery patients.",Excluded,Excluded

42,"Genetic Association of Waist-to-Hip Ratio With Cardiometabolic Traits, Type 2 Diabetes, and Coronary Heart Disease","Importance: In observational studies, abdominal adiposity has been associated with type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD). Whether these associations represent causal relationships remains uncertain., Objective: To test the association of a polygenic risk score for waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) adjusted for body mass index (BMI), a measure of abdominal adiposity, with type 2 diabetes and CHD through the potential intermediates of blood lipids, blood pressure, and glycemic phenotypes., Design, Setting, and Participants: A polygenic risk score for WHR adjusted for BMI, a measure of genetic predisposition to abdominal adiposity, was constructed with 48 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The association of this score with cardiometabolic traits, type 2 diabetes, and CHD was tested in a mendelian randomization analysis that combined case-control and cross-sectional data sets. Estimates for cardiometabolic traits were based on a combined data set consisting of summary results from 4 genome-wide association studies conducted from 2007 to 2015, including up to 322154 participants, as well as individual-level, cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank collected from 2007-2011, including 111986 individuals. Estimates for type 2 diabetes and CHD were derived from summary statistics of 2 separate genome-wide association studies conducted from 2007 to 2015 and including 149821 individuals and 184305 individuals, respectively, combined with individual-level data from the UK Biobank., Exposures: Genetic predisposition to increased WHR adjusted for BMI., Main Outcomes and Measures: Type 2 diabetes and CHD., Results: Among 111986 individuals in the UK Biobank, the mean age was 57 (SD, 8) years, 58845 participants (52.5%) were women, and mean WHR was 0.875. Analysis of summary-level genome-wide association study results and individual-level UK Biobank data demonstrated that a 1-SD increase in WHR adjusted for BMI mediated by the polygenic risk score was associated with 27-mg/dL higher triglyceride levels, 4.1-mg/dL higher 2-hour glucose levels, and 2.1-mm Hg higher systolic blood pressure (each P < .001). A 1-SD genetic increase in WHR adjusted for BMI was also associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.57-2.00]; absolute risk increase per 1000 participant-years, 6.0 [95% CI, CI, 4.4-7.8]; number of participants with type 2 diabetes outcome, 40530) and CHD (odds ratio, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.32-1.62]; absolute risk increase per 1000 participant-years, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.3-2.4]; number of participants with CHD outcome, 66440)., Conclusions and Relevance: A genetic predisposition to higher waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index was associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. These results provide evidence supportive of a causal association between abdominal adiposity and these outcomes.",Included,Included
160,Genetic Determinants of Body Mass Index and Fasting Glucose Are Mediators of Grade 1 Diastolic Dysfunction,"Background Early (grade 1) cardiac left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (G1DD) increases the risk for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and may improve with aggressive risk factor modification. Type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and coronary heart disease are associated with increased incidence of diastolic dysfunction. The genetic drivers of G1DD are not defined. Methods and Results We curated genotyped European ancestry G1DD cases (n=668) and controls with normal diastolic function (n=1772) from Vanderbilt's biobank. G1DD status was explored through (1) an additive model genome-wide association study, (2) shared polygenic risk through logistic regression, and (3) instrumental variable analysis using 2-sample Mendelian randomization (the inverse-variance weighted method, Mendelian randomization-Egger, and median) to determine potential modifiable risk factors. There were no common single nucleotide polymorphisms significantly associated with G1DD status. A polygenic risk score for BMI was significantly associated with increased G1DD risk (odds ratio [OR], 1.20 for 1-SD increase in BMI [95% CI, 1.08-1.32]; P=0.0003). The association was confirmed by the inverse-variance weighted method (OR, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.37-2.61]). Among the candidate mediators for BMI, only fasting glucose was significantly associated with G1DD status by the inverse-variance weighted method (OR, 4.14 for 1-SD increase in fasting glucose [95% CI, 1.55-11.02]; P=0.005). Multivariable Mendelian randomization showed a modest attenuation of the BMI association (OR, 1.84 [95% CI, 1.35-2.52]) when adjusting for fasting glucose. Conclusions These data suggest that a genetic predisposition to elevated BMI increases the risk for G1DD. Part of this effect may be mediated through altered glucose homeostasis.",Excluded,Excluded
159,Genetic Evidence for Causal Relationships Between Maternal Obesity-Related Traits and Birth Weight,"IMPORTANCE: Neonates born to overweight or obese women are larger and at higher risk of birth complications. Many maternal obesity-related traits are observationally associated with birth weight, but the causal nature of these associations is uncertain., OBJECTIVE: To test for genetic evidence of causal associations of maternal body mass index (BMI) and related traits with birth weight., DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Mendelian randomization to test whether maternal BMI and obesity-related traits are potentially causally related to offspring birth weight. Data from 30,487 women in 18 studies were analyzed. Participants were of European ancestry from population- or community-based studies in Europe, North America, or Australia and were part of the Early Growth Genetics Consortium. Live, term, singleton offspring born between 1929 and 2013 were included., EXPOSURES: Genetic scores for BMI, fasting glucose level, type 2 diabetes, systolic blood pressure (SBP), triglyceride level, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level, vitamin D status, and adiponectin level., MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Offspring birth weight from 18 studies., RESULTS: Among the 30,487 newborns the mean birth weight in the various cohorts ranged from 3325 g to 3679 g. The maternal genetic score for BMI was associated with a 2-g (95% CI, 0 to 3 g) higher offspring birth weight per maternal BMI-raising allele (P = .008). The maternal genetic scores for fasting glucose and SBP were also associated with birth weight with effect sizes of 8 g (95% CI, 6 to 10 g) per glucose-raising allele (P = 7 x 10(-14)) and -4 g (95% CI, -6 to -2 g) per SBP-raising allele (P = 1x10(-5)), respectively. A 1-SD ( = 4 points) genetically higher maternal BMI was associated with a 55-g higher offspring birth weight (95% CI, 17 to 93 g). A 1-SD ( = 7.2 mg/dL) genetically higher maternal fasting glucose concentration was associated with 114-g higher offspring birth weight (95% CI, 80 to 147 g). However, a 1-SD ( = 10 mm Hg) genetically higher maternal SBP was associated with a 208-g lower offspring birth weight (95% CI, -394 to -21 g). For BMI and fasting glucose, genetic associations were consistent with the observational associations, but for systolic blood pressure, the genetic and observational associations were in opposite directions., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this mendelian randomization study, genetically elevated maternal BMI and blood glucose levels were potentially causally associated with higher offspring birth weight, whereas genetically elevated maternal SBP was potentially causally related to lower birth weight. If replicated, these findings may have implications for counseling and managing pregnancies to avoid adverse weight-related birth outcomes.",Included,Included
113,Genetic Evidence for Different Adiposity Phenotypes and Their Opposing Influences on Ectopic Fat and Risk of Cardiometabolic Disease,"To understand the causal role of adiposity and ectopic fat in type 2 diabetes and cardiometabolic diseases, we aimed to identify two clusters of adiposity genetic variants: one with ""adverse"" metabolic effects (UFA) and the other with, paradoxically, ""favorable"" metabolic effects (FA). We performed a multivariate genome-wide association study using body fat percentage and metabolic biomarkers from UK Biobank and identified 38 UFA and 36 FA variants. Adiposity-increasing alleles were associated with an adverse metabolic profile, higher risk of disease, higher CRP, and higher fat in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, liver, and pancreas for UFA and a favorable metabolic profile, lower risk of disease, higher CRP and higher subcutaneous adipose tissue but lower liver fat for FA. We detected no sexual dimorphism. The Mendelian randomization studies provided evidence for a risk-increasing effect of UFA and protective effect of FA for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, stroke, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and polycystic ovary syndrome. FA is distinct from UFA by its association with lower liver fat and protection from cardiometabolic diseases; it was not associated with visceral or pancreatic fat. Understanding the difference in FA and UFA may lead to new insights in preventing, predicting, and treating cardiometabolic diseases.

148,Genetic analysis of obstructive sleep apnoea discovers a strong association with cardiometabolic health,"There is currently limited understanding of the genetic aetiology of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). We aimed to identify genetic loci associated with OSA risk, and to test if OSA and its comorbidities share a common genetic background. We conducted the first large-scale genome-wide association study of OSA using the FinnGen study (217 955 individuals) with 16 761 OSA patients identified using nationwide health registries. We estimated 0.08 (95% CI 0.06-0.11) heritability and identified five loci associated with OSA (p<5.0x10-8): rs4837016 near GAPVD1 (GTPase activating protein and VPS9 domains 1), rs10928560 near CXCR4 (C-X-C motif chemokine receptor type 4), rs185932673 near CAMK1D (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ID) and rs9937053 near FTO (fat mass and obesity-associated protein; a variant previously associated with body mass index (BMI)). In a BMI-adjusted analysis, an association was observed for rs10507084 near RMST/NEDD1 (rhabdomyosarcoma 2 associated transcript/NEDD1 gamma-tubulin ring complex targeting factor). We found high genetic correlations between OSA and BMI (rg=0.72 (95% CI 0.62-0.83)), and with comorbidities including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, depression, hypothyroidism, asthma and inflammatory rheumatic disease (rg>0.30). The polygenic risk score for BMI showed 1.98-fold increased OSA risk between the highest and the lowest quintile, and Mendelian randomisation supported a causal relationship between BMI and OSA.Our findings support the causal link between obesity and OSA, and the joint genetic basis between OSA and comorbidities.

37,Genetic determinants of daytime napping and effects on cardiometabolic health,"Daytime napping is a common, heritable behavior, but its genetic basis and causal relationship with cardiometabolic health remain unclear. Here, we perform a genome-wide association study of self-reported daytime napping in the UK Biobank (n = 452,633) and identify 123 loci of which 61 replicate in the 23andMe research cohort (n = 541,333). Findings include missense variants in established drug targets for sleep disorders (HCRTR1, HCRTR2), genes with roles in arousal (TRPC6, PNOC), and genes suggesting an obesity-hypersomnolence pathway (PNOC, PATJ). Association signals are concordant with accelerometer-measured daytime inactivity duration and 33 loci colocalize with loci for other sleep phenotypes. Cluster analysis identifies three distinct clusters of nap-promoting mechanisms with heterogeneous associations with cardiometabolic outcomes. Mendelian randomization shows potential causal links between more frequent daytime napping and higher blood pressure and waist circumference.",Included,Included
176,Genetic evidence for a causal relationship between type 2 diabetes and peripheral artery disease in both Europeans and East Asians,"BACKGROUND: Observational studies have revealed that type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with an increased risk of peripheral artery disease (PAD). However, whether the two diseases share a genetic basis and whether the relationship is causal remain unclear. It is also unclear as to whether these relationships differ between ethnic groups., METHODS: By leveraging large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of T2D (European-based: Ncase = 21,926, Ncontrol = 342,747; East Asian-based: Ncase = 36,614, Ncontrol = 155,150) and PAD (European-based: Ncase = 5673, Ncontrol = 359,551; East Asian-based: Ncase = 3593, Ncontrol = 208,860), we explored the genetic correlation and putative causal relationship between T2D and PAD in both Europeans and East Asians using linkage disequilibrium score regression and seven Mendelian randomization (MR) models. We also performed multi-trait analysis of GWAS and two gene-based analyses to reveal candidate variants and risk genes involved in the shared genetic basis between T2D and PAD., RESULTS: We observed a strong genetic correlation (rg) between T2D and PAD in both Europeans (rg = 0.51; p-value = 9.34 x 10-15) and East Asians (rg = 0.46; p-value = 1.67 x 10-12). The MR analyses provided consistent evidence for a causal effect of T2D on PAD in both ethnicities (odds ratio [OR] = 1.05 to 1.28 for Europeans and 1.15 to 1.27 for East Asians) but not PAD on T2D. This putative causal effect was not influenced by total cholesterol, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, or smoking initiation according to multivariable MR analysis, and the genetic overlap between T2D and PAD was further explored employing an independent European sample through polygenic risk score regression. Multi-trait analysis of GWAS revealed two novel European-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs927742 and rs1734409) associated with the shared genetic basis of T2D and PAD. Gene-based analyses consistently identified one gene ANKFY1 and gene-gene interactions (e.g., STARD10 [European-specific] to AP3S2 [East Asian-specific]; KCNJ11 [European-specific] to KCNQ1 [East Asian-specific]) associated with the trans-ethnic genetic overlap between T2D and PAD, reflecting a common genetic basis for the co-occurrence of T2D and PAD in both Europeans and East Asians., CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the first evidence for a genetically causal effect of T2D on PAD in both Europeans and East Asians. Several candidate variants and risk genes were identified as being associated with this genetic overlap. Our findings emphasize the importance of monitoring PAD status in T2D patients and suggest new genetic biomarkers for screening PAD risk among patients with T2D. Copyright ¬© 2022.

173,Genetic studies of abdominal MRI data identify genes regulating hepcidin as major determinants of liver iron concentration,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Excess liver iron content is common and is linked to the risk of hepatic and extrahepatic diseases. We aimed to identify genetic variants influencing liver iron content and use genetics to understand its link to other traits and diseases., METHODS: First, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 8,289 individuals from UK Biobank, whose liver iron level had been quantified by magnetic resonance imaging, before validating our findings in an independent cohort (n=1,513 from IMI DIRECT). Second, we used Mendelian randomisation to test the causal effects of 25 predominantly metabolic traits on liver iron content. Third, we tested phenome-wide associations between liver iron variants and 770 traits and disease outcomes., RESULTS: We identified 3 independent genetic variants (rs1800562 [C282Y] and rs1799945 [H63D] in HFE and rs855791 [V736A] in TMPRSS6) associated with liver iron content that reached the GWAS significance threshold (p<5x10-8). The 2 HFE variants account for ~85% of all cases of hereditary haemochromatosis. Mendelian randomisation analysis provided evidence that higher central obesity plays a causal role in increased liver iron content. Phenome-wide association analysis demonstrated shared aetiopathogenic mechanisms for elevated liver iron, high blood pressure, cirrhosis, malignancies, neuropsychiatric and rheumatological conditions, while also highlighting inverse associations with anaemias, lipidaemias and ischaemic heart disease., CONCLUSION: Our study provides genetic evidence that mechanisms underlying higher liver iron content are likely systemic rather than organ specific, that higher central obesity is causally associated with higher liver iron, and that liver iron shares common aetiology with multiple metabolic and non-metabolic diseases., LAY SUMMARY: Excess liver iron content is common and is associated with liver diseases and metabolic diseases including diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. We identified 3 genetic variants that are linked to an increased risk of developing higher liver iron content. We show that the same genetic variants are linked to higher risk of many diseases, but they may also be associated with some health advantages. Finally, we use genetic variants associated with waist-to-hip ratio as a tool to show that central obesity is causally associated with increased liver iron content.

170,Genetically Predicted Obesity Causally Increased the Risk of Hypertension Disorders in Pregnancy,"Aims: This study aimed to evaluate the causal association between obesity and hypertension disorders in pregnancy., Methods: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted based on the data obtained from the GIANT (n = 98,697 participants) consortium and FinnGen (n = 96,449 participants) consortium to determine the causal effect of obesity on the risk of hypertension disorders in pregnancy. Based on a genome-wide significance, 14 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with obesity-related databases were used as instrumental variables. The random-effects inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was adopted as the main analysis with a supplemented sensitive analysis of the MR-Egger and weighted median approaches., Results: All three MR methods showed that genetically predicted obesity causally increased the risk of hypertension disorders in pregnancy. IVW analysis provided obesity as a risk factor for hypertension disorders in pregnancy with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.39 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21-1.59; P = 2.46 x 10-6]. Weighted median and MR Egger regression also showed directionally similar results [weighted median OR = 1.49 (95% CI, 1.24-1.79), P = 2.45 x 10-5; MR-Egger OR = 1.95 (95% CI, 1.35-2.82), P = 3.84 x 10-3]. No directional pleiotropic effects were found between obesity and hypertension disorders in pregnancy with both MR-Egger intercepts and funnel plots., Conclusions: Our findings provided directed evidence that obesity was causally associated with a higher risk of hypertension disorders in pregnancy. Taking measures to reduce the proportion of obesity may help reduce the incidence of hypertension disorders in pregnancy. Copyright ¬© 2022 Wang, Tan, Hua, Zhu, Lin, Wu and Liu.",Included,Included
100,Genetically determined intelligence and coronary artery disease risk,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have shown inverse association between intelligence and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear., METHODS: Based on 242 SNPs independently associated with intelligence, we calculated the genetic intelligence score (gIQ) for participants from 10 CAD case-control studies (n = 34,083) and UK Biobank (n = 427,306). From UK Biobank, we extracted phenotypes including body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes (T2D), smoking, hypertension, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, measured intelligence score, and education attainment. To estimate the effects of gIQ on CAD and its related risk factors, regression analyses was applied. Next, we studied the mediatory roles of measured intelligence and educational attainment. Lastly, Mendelian randomization was performed to validate the findings., RESULTS: In CAD case-control studies, one standard deviation (SD) increase of gIQ was related to a 5% decrease of CAD risk (odds ratio [OR] of 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.93 to 0.98; P = 4.93e-5), which was validated in UK Biobank (OR = 0.97; 95% CI 0.96 to 0.99; P = 6.4e-4). In UK Biobank, we also found significant inverse correlations between gIQ and risk factors of CAD including smoking, BMI, T2D, hypertension, and a positive correlation with HDL cholesterol. The association signals between gIQ and CAD as well as its risk factors got largely attenuated after the adjustment of measured intelligence and educational attainment. The causal role of intelligence in mediating CAD risk was confirmed by Mendelian randomization analyses., CONCLUSION: Genetic components of intelligence affect measured intelligence and educational attainment, which subsequently affect the prevalence of CAD via a series of unfavorable risk factor profiles.",Included,Included
108,"Genetically driven adiposity traits increase the risk of coronary artery disease independent of blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, glycaemic traits","Adiposity has been associated with the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in observational studies, but their association may differ according to specific characteristics of studies. In Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, genetic variants are used as instrumental variables (IVs) of exposures to examine causal effects to overcome confounding factors and reverse causation. We performed MR analyses for adiposity (n = 322,154) on risk of CAD (60,801 cases and 123,504 controls) based on the currently largest genome-wide association studies. The estimated associations between adiposity traits and CAD were calculated by an inverse-variance weighted method with and without excluding the IVs, which are associated with the well-known risk factors of CAD. Genetic variants are identified to be associated with the well-known risk factors of CAD by a cross-phenotype meta-analysis method. Our results furnished strong evidence for a causal role of adiposity in risk of CAD, with the odds ratios (ORs) for CAD being 1.53 (95% CI 1.36-1.72) for body mass index (BMI), 1.48 (1.20-1.96) for waist-hip ratio (WHR), and 1.34 (1.07-1.59) for WHR adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI), respectively. After excluding mediators-associated IVs from the MR analyses, the corresponding ORs were 1.46 (1.28-1.67) for BMI, 1.39 (1.01-1.93) for WHR, and 1.38 (1.04-1.84) for WHRadjBMI, respectively. Furthermore, our results suggested that central adiposity and general adiposity might pose a similar risk for CAD. In summary, our data supported that genetically driven adiposity traits imposed the risk of CAD independent of blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, glycaemic traits, and type 2 diabetes.",Included,Included
181,Genetically elevated levels of circulating triglycerides and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity in a Chinese population,"Elevated levels of circulating triglycerides and increased arterial stiffness are associated with cardiovascular disease. Numerous studies have reported an association between levels of circulating triglycerides and arterial stiffness. We used Mendelian randomization to test whether this association is causal. We investigated the association between circulating triglyceride levels, the apolipoprotein A-V (ApoA5) -1131T>C single nucleotide polymorphism and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) by examining data from 4421 subjects aged 18-74 years who were recruited from the Chinese population. baPWV was significantly associated with the levels of circulating triglycerides after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, heart rate, waist-to-hip ratio, antihypertensive treatment and diabetes mellitus status. The -1131C allele was associated with a 5% (95% confidence interval 3-8%) increase in circulating triglycerides (adjusted for age, sex, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, diabetes mellitus and antihypertensive treatment). Instrumental variable analysis showed that genetically elevated levels of circulating triglycerides were not associated with increased baPWV. These results do not support the hypothesis that levels of circulating triglycerides have a causal role in the development of arterial stiffness.",Included,Included

In this study, we aim to investigate the interplay between genetics, educational attainment-an important denominator of lifestyle-and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk., METHODS AND RESULTS: Based on the effect sizes of 74 genetic variants associated with educational attainment, we calculated a 'genetic education score' in 13 080 cases and 14 471 controls and observed an inverse correlation between the score and risk of CAD [P = 1.52 x 10-8; odds ratio (OR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73-0.85 for the higher compared with the lowest score quintile]. We replicated in 146 514 individuals from UK Biobank (P = 1.85 x 10-6) and also found strong associations between the 'genetic education score' with 'modifiable' risk factors including smoking (P = 5.36 x 10-23), body mass index (BMI) (P = 1.66 x 10-30), and hypertension (P = 3.86 x 10-8). Interestingly, these associations were only modestly attenuated by adjustment for years spent in school. In contrast, a model adjusting for BMI and smoking abolished the association signal between the 'genetic education score' and CAD risk suggesting an intermediary role of these two risk factors. Mendelian randomization analyses performed with summary statistics from large genome-wide meta-analyses and sensitivity analysis using 1271 variants affecting educational attainment (OR 0.68 for the higher compared with the lowest score quintile; 95% CI 0.63-0.74; P = 3.99 x 10-21) further strengthened these findings., CONCLUSION: Genetic variants known to affect educational attainment may have implications for a health-conscious lifestyle later in life and subsequently affect the risk of CAD.

11,Genetically predicted 17beta-estradiol and cardiovascular risk factors in women: a Mendelian randomization analysis using young women in Hong Kong and older women in the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study,"PURPOSE: The role of estrogen in cardiovascular health remains contested with discrepancies between findings from randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Mendelian randomization, which assesses the effect of lifelong endogenous exposure, may help elucidate these discrepancies., METHODS: We used separate sample instrumental variable analysis to estimate the association of log 17beta-estradiol with factors related to cardiovascular disease risk (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, lipids, fasting glucose, body mass index, waist hip ratio, and waist circumference) and Framingham score, a predictor of 10-year risk of ischemic heart disease events, in older Chinese women from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (GBCS, n = 3092). The estimate was derived using the Wald estimator, that is, the ratio of the association of genetic determinants (rs1008805 and rs2175898) of log 17beta-estradiol with cardiovascular disease risk factors and Framingham score in GBCS and the association of these genetic determinants with log 17beta-estradiol in a sample of young women from Hong Kong (n = 236)., RESULTS: Genetically, higher 17beta-estradiol was not associated with any cardiovascular disease-related risk factor or with Framingham score (-0.01, 95% confidence interval = -1.34 to 1.31)., CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime exposure to estrogen does not appear to be cardioprotective via the cardiovascular disease-related risk factors examined.

Hence, a novel multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) approach was applied to solve this issue., METHODS: The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) on years of schooling served as instruments. Univariable mendelian randomization (MR) and MVMR analyses were performed to detect the relationship between genetically predicted EA and the stroke risk. In the MVMR, cigarette consumption, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), intelligence, and hypertension were adjusted. The summary statistics for stroke from the MEGASTROKE consortium included 446,696 participants (40,585 cases of stroke and 34,217 cases of ischemic stroke), most of whom were of European descent., RESULTS: In the univariable MR, genetically predicated EA could decrease the risks of total stroke (OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.61-0.72, P = 2.70 x 10-23), ischemic stroke (OR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.61-0.73, P = 2.58 x 10-18), large artery atherosclerosis (OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.40-0.64, P = 1.80 x 10-8), small vessel stroke (OR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.49-0.73, P = 5.59 x 10-7), and cardioembolic stroke (OR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.68-0.96, P = 1.46 x 10-2) using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) estimator. Higher EA might be negatively correlated with the odds of total stroke (OR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.50-0.77, P = 1.44 x 10-5), ischemic stroke (OR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.50-0.80, P = 1.41 x 10-4), and cardioembolic stroke (OR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.39-0.90, P = 0.01), but was not significant in large artery atherosclerosis (OR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.37-1.15, P = 0.14) and small vessel stroke (OR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.41-1.13, P = 0.14) after controlling other exposures., CONCLUSIONS: We found that genetically predicated higher EA decreased the risks of total stroke, ischemic stroke, and cardioembolic stroke, independent of smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI, intelligence, and hypertension.

Multivariable censored and linear regressions were used to examine the association of genetically predicted testosterone levels with CVD risk factors and Framingham score among 4212 older Chinese men from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study., RESULTS: Predicted testosterone was unrelated to systolic blood pressure [-0.11 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.70 to 0.48], diastolic blood pressure (0.04 mmHg, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.36), fasting glucose (0.02 mmol/l, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.06) or Framingham score (0.02, 95% CI -0.0001 to 0.03) but associated with higher LDL-cholesterol (0.02 mmol/l, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.04) and lower HDL-cholesterol (-0.01 mmol/l, 95% CI -0.02 to -0.001), after adjustment for potential confounders (age, education, smoking status, use of alcohol and body mass index)., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings did not corroborate observed protective effects of testosterone on cardiovascular risk factors or risk of ischaemic heart disease among men, but raises the possibility that higher testosterone may be associated with an unhealthier lipid profile.",Included,Included
78,"Genetically, Dietary Sodium Intake Is Causally Associated with Salt-Sensitive Hypertension Risk in a Community-Based Cohort Study: a Mendelian Randomization Approach","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Excessive dietary salt intake is associated with an increased risk of hypertension. Salt sensitivity, i.e., an elevation in blood pressure in response to high dietary salt intake, has been associated with a high risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. We investigated whether a causal association exists between dietary sodium intake and hypertension risk using Mendelian randomization (MR)., RECENT FINDINGS: We performed an MR study using data from a large genome-wide association study comprising 15,034 Korean adults in a community-based cohort study. A total of 1282 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with dietary sodium intake, such as rs2960306, rs4343, and rs1937671, were selected as instrumental variables. The inverse variance weighted method was used to assess the evidence for causality. Higher dietary sodium intake was associated with salt-sensitive hypertension risk. The variants of SLC8E1 rs2241543 and ADD1 rs16843589 were strongly associated with increased blood pressure. In the logistic regression model, after adjusting for age, gender, smoking, drinking, exercise, and body mass index, the GRK4 rs2960306TT genotype was inversely associated with hypertension risk (OR, 0.356; 95% CI, 0.236-0.476). However, the 2350GG genotype (ACE rs4343) exhibited a 2.11-fold increased hypertension risk (OR, 2.114; 95% CI, 2.004-2.224) relative to carriers of the 2350AA genotype, after adjusting for confounders. MR analysis revealed that the odds ratio for hypertension per 1 mg/day increment of dietary sodium intake was 2.24 in participants with the PRKG1 rs12414562 AA genotype. Our findings suggest that dietary sodium intake may be causally associated with hypertension risk.",Included,Included
121,"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Over 170,000 Individuals from the UK Biobank Identifies Seven Loci Associated with Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Diet","Diet is a modifiable risk factor for common chronic diseases and mental health disorders, and its effects are under partial genetic control. To estimate the impact of diet on individual health, most epidemiological and genetic studies have focused on individual aspects of dietary intake. However, analysing individual food groups in isolation does not capture the complexity of the whole diet pattern. Dietary indices enable a holistic estimation of diet and account for the intercorrelations between food and nutrients. In this study we performed the first ever genome-wide association study (GWA) including 173,701 individuals from the UK Biobank to identify genetic variants associated with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. DASH was calculated using the 24 h-recall questionnaire collected by UK Biobank. The GWA was performed using a linear mixed model implemented in BOLT-LMM. We identified seven independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with DASH. Significant genetic correlations were observed between DASH and several educational traits with a significant enrichment for genes involved in the AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) activation that controls the appetite by regulating the signalling in the hypothalamus. The colocalization analysis implicates genes involved in body mass index (BMI)/obesity and neuroticism (ARPP21, RP11-62H7.2, MFHAS1, RHEBL1). The Mendelian randomisation analysis suggested that increased DASH score, which reflect a healthy diet style, is causal of lower glucose, and insulin levels. These findings further our knowledge of the pathways underlying the relationship between diet and health outcomes. They may have significant implications for global public health and provide future dietary recommendations for the prevention of common chronic diseases.",Included,Included

Twelve independent variants at 11 genomic loci are associated with HF, all of which demonstrate one or more associations with coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, or reduced left ventricular function, suggesting shared genetic aetiology. Functional analysis of non-CAD-associated loci implicate genes involved in cardiac development (MYOZ1, SYNPO2L), protein homoeostasis (BAG3), and cellular senescence (CDKN1A). Mendelian randomisation analysis supports causal roles for several HF risk factors, and demonstrates CAD-independent effects for atrial fibrillation, body mass index, and hypertension. These findings extend our knowledge of the pathways underlying HF and may inform new therapeutic strategies.",Excluded,Excluded
128,High-Density Lipoprotein 3 Cholesterol and Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma: Metabolomics and Mendelian Randomization Analyses,"PURPOSE: We hypothesized that the effect of blood lipid-related metabolites on primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) would differ according to specific lipoprotein particles and lipid sub-fractions. We investigated the associations of blood levels of lipoprotein particles and lipid sub-fractions with POAG., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study., PARTICIPANTS: Individuals recruited for the baseline visit of the population-based Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Disease study (n = 8503)., METHODS: All participants underwent detailed standardized ocular and systemic examinations. A total of 130 blood lipid-related metabolites were quantified using a nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics platform. The analyses were conducted in 2 stages. First, we investigated whether and which lipid-related metabolites were directly associated with POAG using regression analyses followed by Bayesian network modeling. Second, we investigated if any causal relationship exists between the identified lipid-related metabolites, if any, and POAG using 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 3 cholesterol (after inverse normal transformation) and used the top variants associated with HLD3 cholesterol as instrumental variables (IVs) in the MR analysis., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary open-angle glaucoma., RESULTS: Of the participants, 175 (2.1%) had POAG. First, a logistic regression model showed that total HDL3 cholesterol (negatively) and phospholipids in very large HDL (positively) were associated with POAG. Further analyses using a Bayesian network analysis showed that only total HDL3 cholesterol was directly associated with POAG (odds ratio [OR], 0.72 per 1 standard deviation increase in HDL3 cholesterol; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-0.84), independently of age, gender, intraocular pressure (IOP), body mass index (BMI), education level, systolic blood pressure, axial length, and statin medication. Using 5 IVs identified from the GWAS and with the inverse variance weighted MR method, we found that higher levels of HDL3 cholesterol were associated with a decreased odds of POAG (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84-0.99, P = 0.021). Other MR methods, including weighted median, mode-based estimator, and contamination mixture methods, derived consistent OR estimates. None of the routine lipids (blood total, HDL, or low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol) were associated with POAG., CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that the relationship between HDL3 cholesterol and POAG might be causal and specific, and that dysregulation of cholesterol transport may play a role in the pathogenesis of POAG.

58,Human genetic determinants of the gut microbiome and their associations with health and disease: a phenome-wide association study,"Small-scale studies have suggested a link between the human gut microbiome and highly prevalent diseases. However, the extent to which the human gut microbiome can be considered a determinant of disease and healthy aging remains unknown. We aimed to determine the spectrum of diseases that are linked to the human gut microbiome through the utilization of its genetic determinants as a proxy for its composition. 180 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to influence the human gut microbiome were used to assess the association with health and disease outcomes in 422,417 UK Biobank participants. Potential causal estimates were obtained using a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. From the total sample analysed (mean age was 57 +/- 8 years), 194,567 (46%) subjects were male. Median exposure was 66-person years (interquartile range 59-72). Eleven SNPs were significantly associated with 28 outcomes (Bonferroni corrected P value < 4.63.10-6) including food intake, hypertension, atopy, COPD, BMI, and lipids. Multiple SNP MR pointed to a possible causal link between Ruminococcus flavefaciens and hypertension, and Clostridium and platelet count. Microbiota and their metabolites might be of importance in the interplay between overlapping pathophysiological processes, although challenges remain in establishing causal relationships.",Excluded,Excluded
154,Identification of Circulating Proteins Associated With Blood Pressure Using Mendelian Randomization,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a common modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Pathophysiological mechanisms leading to hypertension remain incompletely understood. Mendelian randomization (MR) allows the evaluation of the causal role of markers by minimizing the risk of biases such as reverse causation and confounding. We aimed to identify novel circulating proteins associated with blood pressure through a comprehensive screen of 227 blood biomarkers using MR., METHODS: Genetic determinants of 227 biomarkers were identified in ORIGIN (Outcome Reduction With Initial Glargine Intervention; URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT00069784) participants (N=4147) and combined with genetic effects on systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and pulse pressure from the International Consortium for Blood Pressure (74 064 individuals) using MR. Results were replicated in the UK Biobank (up to 319 103 individuals) and using another biomarker dataset (N=3301). MR analyses with cardiovascular risk factors and outcomes as well as other biomarkers were performed to further evaluate the mechanisms involved., RESULTS: Six biomarkers were associated with blood pressure using MR after adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing. Relationships between NT-proBNP (N-terminal Pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure confirmed previous reports. Novel circulating proteins associated with blood pressure were also identified. uPA (urokinase-type plasminogen activator) was related to systolic blood pressure; ADM (adrenomedullin) was related to systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure; IL (interleukin) 16 was related to diastolic blood pressure; cFn (cellular fibronectin) and IGFBP3 (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3) were related to pulse pressure. With the exception of IL16 and diastolic blood pressure (P=0.58), these relationships were validated in the UK Biobank (P<0.0001). Further MR analyses with cardiovascular risk factors and outcomes showed relationships between NT-proBNP and large-artery atherosclerotic stroke, IGFBP3 and diabetes mellitus as well as cFn and body mass index., CONCLUSIONS: We identified novel biomarkers associated with blood pressure using MR. These markers could prove useful for risk assessment and as potential therapeutic targets.",Included,Included
59,Identifying shared genetic loci between coronavirus disease 2019 and cardiovascular diseases based on cross-trait meta-analysis,"People with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have different mortality or severity, and this clinical outcome is thought to be mainly attributed to comorbid cardiovascular diseases. However, genetic loci jointly influencing COVID-19 and cardiovascular disorders remain largely unknown. To identify shared genetic loci between COVID-19 and cardiac traits, we conducted a genome-wide cross-trait meta-analysis. Firstly, from eight cardiovascular disorders, we found positive genetic correlations between COVID-19 and coronary artery disease (CAD, R g = 0.4075, P = 0.0031), type 2 diabetes (T2D, R g = 0.2320, P = 0.0043), obesity (OBE, R g = 0.3451, P = 0.0061), as well as hypertension (HTN, R g = 0.233, P = 0.0026). Secondly, we detected 10 shared genetic loci between COVID-19 and CAD, 3 loci between COVID-19 and T2D, 5 loci between COVID-19 and OBE, and 21 loci between COVID-19 and HTN, respectively. These shared genetic loci were enriched in signaling pathways and secretion pathways. In addition, Mendelian randomization analysis revealed significant causal effect of COVID-19 on CAD, OBE and HTN. Our results have revealed the genetic architecture shared by COVID-19 and CVD, and will help to shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the associations between COVID-19 and cardiac traits.

15,Impact of comorbidities on gout and hyperuricaemia: an update on prevalence and treatment options,"Gout, the most prevalent inflammatory arthritis worldwide, is associated with cardiovascular and renal diseases, and is an independent predictor of premature death. The frequencies of obesity, chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemias, cardiac diseases (including coronary heart disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation), stroke and peripheral arterial disease have been repeatedly shown to be increased in gout. Therefore, the screening and care of these comorbidities as well as of cardiovascular risk factors are of outmost importance in patients with gout. Comorbidities, especially CKD, and drugs prescribed for their treatment, also impact gout management. Numerous epidemiological studies have shown the association of asymptomatic hyperuricaemia with the above-mentioned diseases and cardiovascular risk factors. Animal studies have also produced a mechanistic approach to the vascular toxicity of soluble urate. However, causality remains uncertain because confounders, reverse causality or common etiological factors might explain the epidemiological results. Additionally, these uncertainties remain unsolved despite recent studies using Mendelian randomisation or therapeutic approaches. Thus, large randomised placebo-controlled trials are still needed to assess the benefits of treating asymptomatic hyperuricaemia.",Included,Included
103,Impact of risk factors for major cardiovascular diseases: a comparison of life-time observational and Mendelian randomisation findings,"BACKGROUND: This study compared the strength and causality of associations between major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the four major CVDs: myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Both a long-term follow-up in an observational cohort and Mendelian randomisation (MR) were used for this aim., METHODS: In the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men study, 2322 men, all aged 50 years, were assessed for CVD risk factors and then followed for four decades regarding incident CVDs. The two-sample MR part used public available Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) data., RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, systolic blood pressure was overall by far the most important risk factor, since it was related to all four CVDs, both in observational and MR analyses. Body mass index was the second most overall important risk factor, being linked to all four CVDs, except ischaemic stroke, both in observational and MR analyses. Smoking was an important risk factor for ischaemic stroke and heart failure, both in observational and MR analyses, while low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol mainly was related to myocardial infarction. Diabetes was mainly a causal risk factor for incident myocardial infarction and heart failure. Neither HDL-cholesterol nor triglycerides were of major importance as risk factors in these multivariable models., CONCLUSION: By combining long-term observational data with genetic data, we show that the impact and causal role of specific established cardiovascular risk factors varies between different major CVDs. Systolic blood pressure was causally related to all four cardiovascular outcomes and was therefore, overall, the most important risk factor. Copyright ¬© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

16,Influence of puberty timing on adiposity and cardiometabolic traits: A Mendelian randomisation study,"BACKGROUND: Earlier puberty is widely linked with future obesity and cardiometabolic disease. We examined whether age at puberty onset likely influences adiposity and cardiometabolic traits independent of childhood adiposity., METHODS AND FINDINGS: One-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses were conducted on up to 3,611 white-European female and male offspring from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort recruited at birth via mothers between 1 April 1991 and 31 December 1992. Time-sensitive exposures were age at menarche and age at voice breaking. Outcomes measured at age 18 y were body mass index (BMI), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-based fat and lean mass indices, blood pressure, and 230 cardiometabolic traits derived from targeted metabolomics (150 concentrations plus 80 ratios from nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR] spectroscopy covering lipoprotein subclasses of cholesterol and triglycerides, amino acids, inflammatory glycoproteins, and others). Adjustment was made for pre-pubertal BMI measured at age 8 y. For negative control MR analyses, BMI and cardiometabolic trait measures taken at age 8 y (before puberty, and which therefore cannot be an outcome of puberty itself) were used. For replication analyses, 2-sample MR was conducted using summary genome-wide association study data on up to 322,154 adults for post-pubertal BMI, 24,925 adults for post-pubertal NMR cardiometabolic traits, and 13,848 children for pre-pubertal obesity (negative control). Like observational estimates, 1-sample MR estimates in ALSPAC using 351 polymorphisms for age at menarche (explaining 10.6% of variance) among 2,053 females suggested that later age at menarche (per year) was associated with -1.38 kg/m2 of BMI at age 18 y (or -0.34 SD units, 95% CI -0.46, -0.23; P = 9.77 x 10-09). This coefficient attenuated 10-fold upon adjustment for BMI at age 8 y, to -0.12 kg/m2 (or -0.03 SDs, 95% CI -0.13, 0.07; P = 0.55). Associations with blood pressure were similar, but associations across other traits were small and inconsistent. In negative control MR analyses, later age at menarche was associated with -0.77 kg/m2 of pre-pubertal BMI measured at age 8 y (or -0.39 SDs, 95% CI -0.50, -0.29; P = 6.28 x 10-13), indicating that variants influencing menarche also influence BMI before menarche. Cardiometabolic trait associations were weaker and less consistent among males and both sexes combined. Higher BMI at age 8 y (per 1 kg/m2 using 95 polymorphisms for BMI explaining 3.4% of variance) was associated with earlier menarche among 2,648 females (by -0.26 y, 95% CI -0.37, -0.16; P = 1.16 x 10-06), likewise among males and both sexes combined. In 2-sample MR analyses using 234 polymorphisms and inverse variance weighted (IVW) regression, each year later age at menarche was associated with -0.81 kg/m2 of adult BMI (or -0.17 SD units, 95% CI -0.21, -0.12; P = 4.00 x 10-15). Associations were weaker with cardiometabolic traits. Using 202 polymorphisms, later menarche was associated with lower odds of childhood obesity (IVW-based odds ratio = 0.52 per year later, 95% CI 0.48, 0.57; P = 6.64 x 10-15). Study limitations include modest sample sizes for 1-sample MR, lack of inference to non-white-European populations, potential selection bias through modest completion rates of puberty questionnaires, and likely disproportionate measurement error of exposures by sex. The cardiometabolic traits examined were heavily lipid-focused and did not include hormone-related traits such as insulin and insulin-like growth factors., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that puberty timing has a small influence on adiposity and cardiometabolic traits and that preventive interventions should instead focus on reducing childhood adiposity.",Included,Included
123,Insulin Response to Oral Glucose and Cardiometabolic Disease: A Mendelian Randomization Study to Assess Potential Causality,"Mendelian randomization (MR) suggests that postprandial hyperinsulinemia (unadjusted for plasma glucose) increases BMI, but its impact on cardiometabolic disease, a leading cause for mortality and morbidity in people with obesity, is not established. Fat distribution i.e., increased centripetal and/or reduced femoro-gluteal adiposity, is causally associated with and better predicts cardiometabolic disease than BMI. We therefore undertook bidirectional MR to assess the effect of corrected insulin response (CIR) (insulin 30 min after a glucose challenge adjusted for plasma glucose) on BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), leg fat, type 2 diabetes (T2D), triglyceride (TG), HDL, liver fat, hypertension (HTN), and coronary artery disease (CAD) in people of European descent. Inverse variance-weighted MR suggests a potential causal association between increased CIR and increased BMI (b = 0.048 +/- 0.02, P = 0.03), increased leg fat (b = 0.029 +/- 0.012, P = 0.01), reduced T2D (b = -0.73 +/- 0.15, P = 6 x 10-7, odds ratio [OR] 0.48 [95% CI 0.36-0.64]), reduced TG (b = -0.07 +/- 0.02, P = 0.003), and increased HDL (b = 0.04 +/- 0.01, P = 0.006) with some evidence of horizontal pleiotropy. CIR had neutral effects on WHR (b = 0.009 +/- 0.02, P = 0.69), liver fat (b = -0.08 +/- 0.04, P = 0.06), HTN (b = -0.001 +/- 0.004, P = 0.7, OR 1.00 [95% CI 0.99-1.01]), and CAD (b = -0.002 +/- 0.002, P = 0.48, OR 0.99 [95% CI 0.81-1.21]). T2D decreased CIR (b -0.22 +/- 0.04, P = 1.3 x 10-7), with no evidence that BMI, TG, HDL, liver fat, HTN, and CAD modulate CIR. In conclusion, we did not find evidence that increased CIR increases cardiometabolic disease. It might increase BMI with favorable fat distribution, reduce T2D, and improve lipids.

145,Interaction-based Mendelian randomization with measured and unmeasured gene-by-covariate interactions,"Studies leveraging gene-environment (GxE) interactions within Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses have prompted the emergence of two similar methodologies: MR-GxE and MR-GENIUS. Such methods are attractive in allowing for pleiotropic bias to be corrected when using individual instruments. Specifically, MR-GxE requires an interaction to be explicitly identified, while MR-GENIUS does not. We critically examine the assumptions of MR-GxE and MR-GENIUS in the absence of a pre-defined covariate, and propose sensitivity analyses to evaluate their performance. Finally, we explore the effect of body mass index (BMI) upon systolic blood pressure (SBP) using data from the UK Biobank, finding evidence of a positive effect of BMI on SBP. We find both approaches share similar assumptions, though differences between the approaches lend themselves to differing research settings. Where a suitable gene-by-covariate interaction is observed MR-GxE can produce unbiased causal effect estimates. MR-GENIUS can circumvent the need to identify interactions, but as a consequence relies on either the MR-GxE assumptions holding globally, or additional information with respect to the distribution of pleiotropic effects in the absence of an explicitly defined interaction covariate.",Included,Included
183,Investigating the causal effect of fibroblast growth factor 23 on osteoporosis and cardiometabolic disorders: A Mendelian randomization study,"Pathological excess of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) causes mineral and bone disorders. However, the causality of FGF23 in the development of osteoporosis remains unknown. Whether FGF23 has systemic effects on cardiometabolic disorders beyond regulating mineral metabolism is also controversial. In this study, we investigated the causal effect of FGF23 on osteoporosis and cardiometabolic disorders using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Summary statistics for single-nucleotide polymorphisms with traits of interest were obtained from the relevant genome-wide association studies. As a result, FGF23 was found to be inversely associated with femoral neck-BMD (odds ratio [OR] 0.682, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.546-0.853, p = 8e-04) and heel estimated BMD (eBMD) (OR 0.898, 95%CI 0.820-0.985, p = 0.022) in the inverse-variance-weighted analysis, but not lumbar spine-BMD and fractures. The results were supported by the weighted-median analysis, and there was no evidence of pleiotropy in the MR-Egger analysis. FGF23 was associated with FN-BMD and eBMD after adjustment for estimated glomerular filtration rate, height, and body mass index in multivariable MR analysis. On the other hand, there was no association between FGF23 and cardiometabolic traits including cardio artery disease, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity, intima-media thickness of carotid arteries, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, high and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. Therefore, this MR study established that FGF23 was involved in bone loss and, in contrast, was not involved in cardiometabolic disorders. Our findings provide important insights into the role of FGF23 in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and cardiometabolic disorders. Copyright ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

12,Is aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 a credible genetic instrument for alcohol use in Mendelian randomization analysis in Southern Chinese men?,"BACKGROUND: Mendelian randomization studies provide a means of assessing causal relations without interventions, but require valid genetic instruments. We assessed the credibility of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) as a genetic instrument for alcohol use in Southern Chinese men., METHODS: We genotyped the single nucleotide polymorphism rs671 of ALDH2 in 4867 men from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. We used linear regression to assess the strength of the association of ALDH2 variants with alcohol use, whether ALDH2 variants were independently associated with socio-economic position or other potential confounders and whether associations of ALDH2 variants with cardiovascular risk factors (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, fasting glucose), triglycerides, body mass index, self reported cardiovascular disease, self-reported ischaemic heart disease, cognitive function (delayed 10-word recall and Mini Mental State Examination score) and liver function (alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase) were fully mediated by alcohol use., RESULTS: The minor allele frequency (A) of ALDH2 was 0.29. The F statistic for ALDH2 variants was 75.0, suggesting that substantial weak instrument bias is unlikely. ALDH2 variants were not associated with socio-economic position, smoking or physical activity. ALDH2 variants were only associated with diastolic blood pressure and HDL-cholesterol, but these genetic associations with blood pressure and HDL-cholesterol were attenuated after adjusting for alcohol use, suggesting the apparent genetic associations were possibly mediated by alcohol use., CONCLUSIONS: ALDH2 variants are a credible genetic instrument for Mendelian randomization studies of alcohol use and many attributes of health in Southern Chinese men.",Included,Included

We used the estimated odds ratio of glioma associated with each of the genetically defined traits to infer evidence for a causal relationship with the following exposures:Lifestyle and dietary factors-height, plasma insulin-like growth factor 1, blood carnitine, blood methionine, blood selenium, blood zinc, circulating adiponectin, circulating carotenoids, iron status, serum calcium, vitamins (A1, B12, B6, E, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D), fatty acid levels (monounsaturated, omega-3, and omega-6) and circulating fetuin-A;Cardiometabolic factors-birth weight, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, total triglycerides, basal metabolic rate, body fat percentage, body mass index, fasting glucose, fasting proinsulin, glycated hemoglobin levels, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio; andInflammatory factors- C-reactive protein, plasma interleukin-6 receptor subunit alpha and serum immunoglobulin E., RESULTS: After correction for the testing of multiple potential risk factors and excluding associations driven by one single nucleotide polymorphism, no significant association with glioma risk was observed (ie, PCorrected > 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: This study did not provide evidence supporting any of the 37 factors examined as having a significant influence on glioma risk.

We conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to explore this. Independent genetic variants strongly associated with 5 lifestyle and 9 metabolic factors were selected as instrumental variables from corresponding genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Summary-level data for NAFLD were obtained from a GWAS meta-analysis of 8434 cases and 770,180 non-cases (discovery dataset) and another GWAS meta-analysis of 1483 cases and 17,781 non-cases (replication dataset). Univariable and multivariable MR analyses were performed. There were associations with NAFLD for lifetime smoking index (odds ratio (OR) 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31-1.93 per SD-increase), body mass index (BMI, OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.23-1.43 per SD-increase), waist circumference (OR 1.82; 95% CI 1.48-2.24 per SD-increase), type 2 diabetes (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.15-1.27 per unit increase in log-transformed odds), systolic blood pressure (OR 1.17; 95% CI 1.07-1.26 per 10 mmHg increase), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.77-0.90 per SD-increase), and triglycerides (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.15-1.33 per SD-increase). The associations for type 2 diabetes, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, but not for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol remained strong after adjusting for genetically-predicted BMI. Genetic liability to type 2 diabetes mediated 51.4% (95% CI 13.4-89.3%) of the BMI-effects on NAFLD risk. There were suggestive inverse associations of genetically-predicted alcohol, coffee, and caffeine consumption, and vigorous physical activity with NAFLD risk.

86,Lifetime body mass index and later atherosclerosis risk in young adults: examining causal links using Mendelian randomization in the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns study,"AIMS: Mendelian randomization uses genetic variants related to environmentally modifiable risk factors in an attempt to improve causal inference from observational data. We examined the effect of lifetime body mass index (BMI) on adult carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and various atherosclerotic risk factors by using both Mendelian randomization and conventional analyses., METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 2230 individuals (1218 women), aged 3-18 at study induction, took part in clinical examinations in 1980, 1983, 1986, and, most recently, 2001 when they were aged 24-39. In these analyses we utilized the known relation between FTO polymorphism rs9939609 and BMI. The dose-response association between the number of A alleles in FTO and higher mean BMI from childhood to adulthood was confirmed, but no associations with potential confounding factors were observed. In standard regression models, lifetime BMI was associated with adult CIMT, lifetime systolic blood pressure, adult fasting glucose, and adult HOMA-index. When variation in FTO was used as an instrument for unconfounded BMI levels, similar or larger effects of lifetime BMI on all these phenotypes were found, although with wider confidence intervals., CONCLUSION: Mutually supportive results from Mendelian randomization and standard regression models strengthen the evidence of the effect of lifetime BMI on atherosclerosis risk in young adults.",Included,Included
155,Lipid and metabolic syndrome traits in coronary artery disease: a Mendelian randomization study,"Mendelian randomization (MR) of lipid traits in CAD has provided evidence for causal associations of LDL-C and TGs in CAD, but many lipid trait genetic variants have pleiotropic effects on other cardiovascular risk factors that may bias MR associations. The goal of this study was to evaluate pleiotropic effects of lipid trait genetic variants and to account for these effects in MR of lipid traits in CAD. We performed multivariable MR using inverse variance-weighted and MR-Egger methods in large (n >= 300,000) GWAS datasets. We found that 30% of lipid trait genetic variants have effects on metabolic syndrome traits, including BMI, T2D, and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Nonetheless, in multivariable MR analysis, LDL-C, HDL-C, TGs, BMI, T2D, and SBP are independently associated with CAD, and each of these associations is robust to adjustment for directional pleiotropy. MR at loci linked to direct effects on HDL-C and TGs suggests locus- and mechanism-specific causal effects of these factors on CAD. Copyright ¬© 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, hypothesis-driven epidemiological analyses by definition only test particular hypotheses chosen by researchers. Furthermore, observational analyses may not provide robust evidence of causality, as they are susceptible to confounding, reverse causation and measurement error. Using body mass index (BMI) as an exemplar, we demonstrate a novel extension to the phenome-wide association study (pheWAS) approach, using automated screening with genotypic instruments to screen for causal associations amongst any number of phenotypic outcomes. We used a sample of 8,121 children from the ALSPAC dataset, and tested the linear association of a BMI-associated allele score with 172 phenotypic outcomes (with variable sample sizes). We also performed an instrumental variable analysis to estimate the causal effect of BMI on each phenotype. We found 21 of the 172 outcomes were associated with the allele score at an unadjusted p < 0.05 threshold, and use Bonferroni corrections, permutation testing and estimates of the false discovery rate to consider the strength of results given the number of tests performed. The most strongly associated outcomes included leptin, lipid profile, and blood pressure. We also found novel evidence of effects of BMI on a global self-worth score.",Excluded,Excluded
9,Maternal Hypertension Increases Risk of Preeclampsia and Low Fetal Birthweight: Genetic Evidence From a Mendelian Randomization Study,"BACKGROUND: Maternal cardiovascular risk factors have been associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Given the difficulty in establishing causal relationships using epidemiological data, we applied Mendelian randomization to explore the role of cardiovascular risk factors on risk of developing preeclampsia or eclampsia, and low fetal birthweight., METHODS: Uncorrelated single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated systolic blood pressure (SBP), body mass index, type 2 diabetes, LDL (low-density lipoprotein) with cholesterol, smoking, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and estimated glomerular filtration rate at genome-wide significance in studies of 298 957 to 1 201 909 European ancestry participants were selected as instrumental variables. A 2-sample Mendelian randomization study was performed with primary outcome of preeclampsia or eclampsia (PET). Risk factors associated with PET were further investigated for their association with low birthweight., RESULTS: Higher genetically predicted SBP was associated increased risk of PET (odds ratio [OR] per 1-SD SBP increase 1.90 [95% CI=1.45-2.49]; P=3.23x10-6) and reduced birthweight (OR=0.83 [95% CI=0.79-0.86]; P=3.96x10-18), and this was not mediated by PET. Body mass index and type 2 diabetes were also associated with PET (respectively, OR per 1-SD body mass index increase =1.67 [95% CI=1.44-1.94]; P=7.45x10-12; and OR per logOR increase type 2 diabetes =1.11 [95% CI=1.04-1.19]; P=1.19x10-3), but not with reduced birthweight., CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence for causal effects of SBP, body mass index, and type 2 diabetes on PET and identify that SBP is associated with reduced birthweight independently of PET. The results provide insight into the pathophysiological basis of PET and identify hypertension as a potentially modifiable risk factor amenable to therapeutic intervention.",Included,Included
136,Mendelian Randomization Analyses Suggest Childhood Body Size Indirectly Influences End Points From Across the Cardiovascular Disease Spectrum Through Adult Body Size,"Background Obesity is associated with long-term health consequences including cardiovascular disease. Separating the independent effects of childhood and adulthood obesity on cardiovascular disease risk is challenging as children with obesity typically remain overweight throughout the lifecourse. Methods and Results This study used 2-sample univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization to estimate the effect of childhood body size both independently and after accounting for adult body size on 12 endpoints across the cardiovascular disease disease spectrum. Univariable analyses identified strong evidence of a total effect between genetically predicted childhood body size and increased risk of atherosclerosis, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, heart failure, hypertension, myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, and varicose veins. However, evidence of a direct effect was weak after accounting for adult body size using multivariable Mendelian randomization, suggesting that childhood body size indirectly increases risk of these 8 disease outcomes via the pathway involving adult body size. Conclusions These findings suggest that the effect of genetically predicted childhood body size on the cardiovascular disease outcomes analyzed in this study are a result of larger body size persisting into adulthood. Further research is necessary to ascertain the critical timepoints where, if ever, the detrimental impact of obesity initiated in early life begins to become immutable.",Excluded,Excluded
111,Mendelian Randomization Study of Obesity and Cerebrovascular Disease,"OBJECTIVE: To systematically investigate causal relationships between obesity and cerebrovascular disease and the extent to which hypertension and hyperglycemia mediate the effect of obesity on cerebrovascular disease., METHODS: We used summary statistics from genome-wide association studies for body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and multiple cerebrovascular disease phenotypes. We explored causal associations with 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) accounting for genetic covariation between BMI and WHR, and we assessed what proportion of the association between obesity and cerebrovascular disease was mediated by systolic blood pressure (SBP) and blood glucose levels, respectively., RESULTS: Genetic predisposition to higher BMI did not increase the risk of cerebrovascular disease. In contrast, for each 10% increase in WHR there was a 75% increase (95% confidence interval [CI] = 44-113%) in risk for large artery ischemic stroke, a 57% (95% CI = 29-91%) increase in risk for small vessel ischemic stroke, a 197% increase (95% CI = 59-457%) in risk of intracerebral hemorrhage, and an increase in white matter hyperintensity volume (beta = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.01-0.21). These WHR associations persisted after adjusting for genetic determinants of BMI. Approximately one-tenth of the observed effect of WHR was mediated by SBP for ischemic stroke (proportion mediated: 12%, 95% CI = 4-20%), but no evidence of mediation was found for average blood glucose., INTERPRETATION: Abdominal adiposity may trigger causal pathological processes, partially independent from blood pressure and totally independent from glucose levels, that lead to cerebrovascular disease. Potential targets of these pathological processes could represent novel therapeutic opportunities for stroke. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:516-524.

48,Mendelian randomisation in type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease,"Type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease and hypertension are associated with anthropometric and biomarker traits, including waist-to-hip-ratio, body mass index and altered glucose and insulin levels. Clinical trials, for example of weight-loss interventions, show these factors are causal, but lifelong impact of subtle changes in body mass index and body fat distribution are less clear. The use of human genetics can quantify the causal effects of long-term exposure to subtle changes of modifiable risk factors. Mendelian randomisation (MR) uses human genetic variants associated with the risk factor to quantify the relationship between risk factor and disease outcome. The last two years have seen an increase in the number of MR studies investigating the relationship between anthropometric traits and metabolic diseases. This review provides an overview of these recent MR studies in relation to type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease and hypertension. MR provides evidence for causal associations of waist-to-hip-ratio, body mass index and altered glucose levels with type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease and hypertension. Crown Copyright ¬© 2018.

199,Mendelian randomization analysis does not support causal associations of birth weight with hypertension risk and blood pressure in adulthood,"Epidemiology studies suggested that low birthweight was associated with a higher risk of hypertension in later life. However, little is known about the causality of such associations. In our study, we evaluated the causal association of low birthweight with adulthood hypertension following a standard analytic protocol using the study-level data of 183,433 participants from 60 studies (CHARGE-BIG consortium), as well as that with blood pressure using publicly available summary-level genome-wide association data from EGG consortium of 153,781 participants, ICBP consortium and UK Biobank cohort together of 757,601 participants. We used seven SNPs as the instrumental variable in the study-level analysis and 47 SNPs in the summary-level analysis. In the study-level analyses, decreased birthweight was associated with a higher risk of hypertension in adults (the odds ratio per 1 standard deviation (SD) lower birthweight, 1.22; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.28), while no association was found between genetically instrumented birthweight and hypertension risk (instrumental odds ratio for causal effect per 1 SD lower birthweight, 0.97; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.41). Such results were consistent with that from the summary-level analyses, where the genetically determined low birthweight was not associated with blood pressure measurements either. One SD lower genetically determined birthweight was not associated with systolic blood pressure (beta = - 0.76, 95% CI - 2.45 to 1.08 mmHg), 0.06 mmHg lower diastolic blood pressure (beta = - 0.06, 95% CI - 0.93 to 0.87 mmHg), or pulse pressure (beta = - 0.65, 95% CI - 1.38 to 0.69 mmHg, all p > 0.05). Our findings suggest that the inverse association of birthweight with hypertension risk from observational studies was not supported by large Mendelian randomization analyses.",Excluded,Excluded
178,Mendelian randomization estimates of alanine aminotransferase with cardiovascular disease: Guangzhou Biobank Cohort study,"Observational studies of the association of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels with ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors are inconsistent, probably because of confounding and reverse causality. Mendelian randomization (MR) provides less confounded results. We used MR analysis to assess the associations of ALT (U/L) with IHD, diabetes and other CVD risk factors. We used instrumental variable analysis based on two single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) HSD17B13/MAPK10 (rs6834314) and PNPLA3/SAMM50 (rs738409) to assess the associations of ALT (U/L) with IHD, diabetes and other CVD risk factors in the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (GBCS). Observationally in 19,925 participants ALT levels were strongly positively associated with self-reported IHD, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein- and total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, body mass index, waist circumference, heart rate (HR) and diabetes, but were not associated with uncorrected QT interval, HR-corrected QT interval or high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. In the MR study, using a credible genetic instrument (F-statistic = 23) for ALT, ALT levels were negatively associated with IHD (odds ratio (OR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 0.97) and triglycerides (beta - 0.08, 95% CI - 0.13 to - 0.03), but were not associated with other CVD risk factors. Our results using Mendelian randomization suggest that ALT reduces the risk of IHD, probably through reducing triglyceride levels. The underlying mechanisms deserve further investigation.

151,Mendelian randomization provides support for obesity as a risk factor for meningioma,"Little is known about the causes of meningioma. Obesity and obesity-related traits have been reported in several epidemiological observational studies to be risk factors for meningioma. We performed an analysis of genetic variants associated with obesity-related traits to assess the relationship with meningioma risk using Mendelian randomization (MR), an approach unaffected by biases from temporal variability and reverse causation that might have affected earlier investigations. We considered 11 obesity-related traits, identified genetic instruments for these factors, and assessed their association with meningioma risk using data from a genome-wide association study comprising 1,606 meningioma patients and 9,823 controls. To evaluate the causal relationship between the obesity-related traits and meningioma risk, we consider the estimated odds ratio (OR) of meningioma for each genetic instrument. We identified positive associations between body mass index (odds ratio [ORSD] = 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03-1.56, P = 0.028) and body fat percentage (ORSD = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.01-1.63, P = 0.042) with meningioma risk, albeit non-significant after correction for multiple testing. Associations for basal metabolic rate, diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglycerides and waist circumference with risk of meningioma were non-significant. Our analysis provides additional support for obesity being associated with an increased risk of meningioma.",Included,Included
77,Mendelian randomization studies in coronary artery disease,"Epidemiological research over the last 50 years has discovered a plethora of biomarkers (including molecules, traits or other diseases) that associate with coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Even the strongest association detected in such observational research precludes drawing conclusions about the causality underlying the relationship between biomarker and disease. Mendelian randomization (MR) studies can shed light on the causality of associations, i.e whether, on the one hand, the biomarker contributes to the development of disease or, on the other hand, the observed association is confounded by unrecognized exogenous factors or due to reverse causation, i.e. due to the fact that prevalent disease affects the level of the biomarker. However, conclusions from a MR study are based on a number of important assumptions. A prerequisite for such studies is that the genetic variant employed affects significantly the biomarker under investigation but has no effect on other phenotypes that might confound the association between the biomarker and disease. If this biomarker is a true causal risk factor for CAD, genotypes of the variant should associate with CAD risk in the direction predicted by the association of the biomarker with CAD. Given a random distribution of exogenous factors in individuals carrying respective genotypes, groups represented by the genotypes are highly similar except for the biomarker of interest. Thus, the genetic variant converts into an unconfounded surrogate of the respective biomarker. This scenario is nicely exemplified for LDL cholesterol. Almost every genotype found to increase LDL cholesterol level by a sufficient amount has also been found to increase CAD risk. Pending a number of conditions that needed to be fulfilled by the genetic variant under investigation (e.g. no pleiotropic effects) and the experimental set-up of the study, LDL cholesterol can be assumed to act as the functional component that links genotypes and CAD risk and, more importantly, it can be assumed that any modulation of LDL cholesterol-by whatever mechanism-would have similar effects on disease risk. Therefore, MR analysis has tremendous potential for identifying therapeutic targets that are likely to be causal for CAD. This review article discusses the opportunities and challenges of MR studies for CAD, highlighting several examples that involved multiple biomarkers, including various lipid and inflammation traits as well as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity.

135,Mendelian randomization study of B-type natriuretic peptide and type 2 diabetes: evidence of causal association from population studies,"BACKGROUND: Genetic and epidemiological evidence suggests an inverse association between B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels in blood and risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but the prospective association of BNP with T2D is uncertain, and it is unclear whether the association is confounded., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analysed the association between levels of the N-terminal fragment of pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP) in blood and risk of incident T2D in a prospective case-cohort study and genotyped the variant rs198389 within the BNP locus in three T2D case-control studies. We combined our results with existing data in a meta-analysis of 11 case-control studies. Using a Mendelian randomization approach, we compared the observed association between rs198389 and T2D to that expected from the NT-pro-BNP level to T2D association and the NT-pro-BNP difference per C allele of rs198389. In participants of our case-cohort study who were free of T2D and cardiovascular disease at baseline, we observed a 21% (95% CI 3%-36%) decreased risk of incident T2D per one standard deviation (SD) higher log-transformed NT-pro-BNP levels in analysis adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, smoking, family history of T2D, history of hypertension, and levels of triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The association between rs198389 and T2D observed in case-control studies (odds ratio = 0.94 per C allele, 95% CI 0.91-0.97) was similar to that expected (0.96, 0.93-0.98) based on the pooled estimate for the log-NT-pro-BNP level to T2D association derived from a meta-analysis of our study and published data (hazard ratio = 0.82 per SD, 0.74-0.90) and the difference in NT-pro-BNP levels (0.22 SD, 0.15-0.29) per C allele of rs198389. No significant associations were observed between the rs198389 genotype and potential confounders., CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence for a potential causal role of the BNP system in the aetiology of T2D. Further studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms underlying this association and possibilities for preventive interventions.

187,Metabolic and lifestyle factors in relation to senile cataract: a Mendelian randomization study,"We conducted a Mendelian randomization study to determine the associations of body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes (T2D), systolic blood pressure (SBP), coffee and alcohol consumption and smoking initiation with senile cataract. Independent single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with the metabolic and lifestyle factors at the p < 5 x 10-8 were selected as instrument variables. Summary-level data for senile cataract were obtained from the FinnGen consortium (20,157 cases and 154,905 non-cases) and UK Biobank study (6332 cases and 354,862 non-cases). Higher genetically predicted BMI and SBP and genetic predisposition to T2D and smoking initiation were associated with an increased risk of senile cataract. The combined odds ratios were 1.19 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-1.29; p < 0.001) per one standard deviation increase in BMI (~ 4.8 kg/m2), 1.13 (95% CI 1.04-1.23; p = 0.004) per 10 mmHg increase in SBP, 1.06 (95% CI 1.03-1.09; p < 0.001) per one unit increase in log-transformed odds ratio of T2D, and 1.19 (95% CI 1.10-1.29; p < 0.001) per one standard deviation increase in prevalence of smoking initiation. Genetically predicted coffee consumption showed a suggestive association with senile cataract (odds ratio per 50% increase, 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.40; p = 0.050).

110,Midlife vascular risk factors and risk of incident dementia: Longitudinal cohort and Mendelian randomization analyses in the UK Biobank,"INTRODUCTION: Midlife clustering of vascular risk factors has been associated with late-life dementia, but causal effects of individual biological and lifestyle factors remain largely unknown., METHODS: Among 229,976 individuals (mean follow-up 9 years), we explored whether midlife cardiovascular health measured by Life's Simple 7 (LS7) is associated with incident all-cause dementia and whether the individual components of the score are causally associated with dementia., RESULTS: Adherence to the biological metrics of LS7 (blood pressure, cholesterol, glycemic status) was associated with lower incident dementia risk (hazard ratio = 0.93 per 1-point increase, 95% confidence interval [CI; 0.89-0.96]). In contrast, there was no association between the composite LS7 score and the lifestyle subscore (smoking, body mass index, diet, physical activity) and incident dementia. In Mendelian randomization analyses, genetically elevated blood pressure was associated with higher risk of dementia (odds ratio = 1.31 per one-standard deviation increase, 95% CI [1.05-1.60])., DISCUSSION: These findings underscore the importance of blood pressure control in midlife to mitigate dementia risk.

81,Modifiable Risk Factors for Intracranial Aneurysm and Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: A Mendelian Randomization Study,"Background The aim of this study was to assess the associations of modifiable lifestyle factors (smoking, coffee consumption, sleep, and physical activity) and cardiometabolic factors (body mass index, glycemic traits, type 2 diabetes, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, lipids, and inflammation and kidney function markers) with risks of any (ruptured or unruptured) intracranial aneurysm and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage using Mendelian randomization. Methods and Results Summary statistical data for the genetic associations with the modifiable risk factors and the outcomes were obtained from meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies. The inverse-variance weighted method was used as the main Mendelian randomization analysis, with additional sensitivity analyses conducted using methods more robust to horizontal pleiotropy. Genetic predisposition to smoking, insomnia, and higher blood pressure was associated with an increased risk of both intracranial aneurysm and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. For intracranial aneurysm, the odds ratios were 3.20 (95% CI, 1.93-5.29) per SD increase in smoking index, 1.24 (95% CI, 1.10-1.40) per unit increase in log-odds of insomnia, and 2.92 (95% CI, 2.49-3.43) per 10 mm Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure. In addition, there was weak evidence for associations of genetically predicted decreased physical activity, higher triglyceride levels, higher body mass index, and lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels with higher risk of intracranial aneurysm and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, with 95% CI overlapping the null for at least 1 of the outcomes. All results were consistent in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions This Mendelian randomization study suggests that smoking, insomnia, and high blood pressure are major risk factors for intracranial aneurysm and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.",Included,Included
89,"Molecular sources of residual cardiovascular risk, clinical signals, and innovative solutions: relationship with subclinical disease, undertreatment, and poor adherence: implications of new evidence upon optimizing cardiovascular patient outcomes","Residual risk, the ongoing appreciable risk of major cardiovascular events (MCVE) in statin-treated patients who have achieved evidence-based lipid goals, remains a concern among cardiologists. Factors that contribute to this continuing risk are atherogenic non-low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles and atherogenic processes unrelated to LDL cholesterol, including other risk factors, the inherent properties of statin drugs, and patient characteristics, ie, genetics and behaviors. In addition, providers, health care systems, the community, public policies, and the environment play a role. Major statin studies suggest an average 28% reduction in LDL cholesterol and a 31% reduction in relative risk, leaving a residual risk of about 69%. Incomplete reductions in risk, and failure to improve conditions that create risk, may result in ongoing progression of atherosclerosis, with new and recurring lesions in original and distant culprit sites, remodeling, arrhythmias, rehospitalizations, invasive procedures, and terminal disability. As a result, identification of additional agents to reduce residual risk, particularly administered together with statin drugs, has been an ongoing quest. The current model of atherosclerosis involves many steps during which disease may progress independently of guideline-defined elevations in LDL cholesterol. Differences in genetic responsiveness to statin therapy, differences in ability of the endothelium to regenerate and repair, and differences in susceptibility to nonlipid risk factors, such as tobacco smoking, hypertension, and molecular changes associated with obesity and diabetes, may all create residual risk. A large number of inflammatory and metabolic processes may also provide eventual therapeutic targets to lower residual risk. Classically, epidemiologic and other evidence suggested that raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol would be cardioprotective. When LDL cholesterol is aggressively lowered to targets, low HDL cholesterol levels are still inversely related to MCVE. The efflux capacity, or ability to relocate cholesterol out of macrophages, is believed to be a major antiatherogenic mechanism responsible for reduction in MCVE mediated in part by healthy HDL. HDL cholesterol is a complex molecule with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, antiplatelet, and vasodilatory properties, among which is protection of LDL from oxidation. HDL-associated paraoxonase-1 has a major effect on endothelial function. Further, HDL promotes endothelial repair and progenitor cell health, and supports production of nitric oxide. HDL from patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and autoimmune disease may fail to protect or even become proinflammatory or pro-oxidant. Mendelian randomization and other clinical studies in which raising HDL cholesterol has not been beneficial suggest that high plasma levels do not necessarily reduce cardiovascular risk. These data, coupled with extensive preclinical information about the functional heterogeneity of HDL, challenge the ""HDL hypothesis"", ie, raising HDL cholesterol per se will reduce MCVE. After the equivocal AIM-HIGH (Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome With Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes) study and withdrawal of two major cholesteryl ester transfer protein compounds, one for off-target adverse effects and the other for lack of efficacy, development continues for two other agents, ie, anacetrapib and evacetrapib, both of which lower LDL cholesterol substantially. The negative but controversial HPS2-THRIVE (the Heart Protection Study 2-Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events) trial casts further doubt on the HDL cholesterol hypothesis. The growing impression that HDL functionality, rather than abundance, is clinically important is supported by experimental evidence highlighting the conditional pleiotropic actions of HDL. Non-HDL cholesterol reflects the cholesterol in all atherogenic particles containing apolipoprotein B, and has outperformed LDL cholesterol as a lipid marker of cardiovascular risk and future mortality. In addition to including a measure of residual risk, the advantages of using non-HDL cholesterol as a primary lipid target are now compelling. Reinterpretation of data from the Treating to New Targets study suggests that better control of smoking, body weight, hypertension, and diabetes will help lower residual risk. Although much improved, control of risk factors other than LDL cholesterol currently remains inadequate due to shortfalls in compliance with guidelines and poor patient adherence. More efficient and greater use of proven simple therapies, such as aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, combined with statin therapy, may be more fruitful in improving outcomes than using other complex therapies. Comprehensive, intensive, multimechanistic, global, and national programs using primordial, primary, and secondary prevention to lower the total level of cardiovascular risk are necessary.",Included,Included
76,Multiple genetic variants explain measurable variance in type 2 diabetes-related traits in Pakistanis,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Multiple genetic variants are associated with type 2 diabetes-related traits in Europeans, but their role in South Asian populations needs further study. We hypothesised that genetic variants associated with diabetes-related traits in Europeans would explain a similar proportion of phenotypic variance in a Pakistani population and could be used in Mendelian randomisation analyses., METHODS: We used data from 2,131 individuals from the Control of Blood Pressure and Risk Attenuation Trial (COBRA) in Karachi, Pakistan. Individuals were aged 40 years or older., RESULTS: Combining information from multiple genetic variants showed that fasting glucose, BMI, triacylglycerol, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure variants explained 2.9%, 0.7%, 5.5%, 1.2% and 1.8% of the variance in those traits respectively. Genetic risk scores of fasting glucose, triacylglycerol, BMI, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure variants were associated with these traits, with per allele SD effects of 0.057 (95% CI 0.041, 0.074), p=3.44 x 10(-12), 0.130 (95% CI 0.105, 0.155), p=2.9 x 10(-21), 0.04 (95% CI 0.014, 0.072), p=0.004, 0.031 (95% CI 0.016, 0.047), p=7.9 x 10(-5), 0.028 (95% CI 0.015, 0.042), p = 5.5 x 10(-5), respectively. These effects are consistent with those observed in Europeans, except that the effect of triacylglycerol variants in South Asians was slightly lower. Mendelian randomisation provided evidence that genetically influenced, raised triacylglycerol levels do not causally affect type 2 diabetes risk to the extent predicted from observational data (p=0.0003 for difference between observed and instrumental variables correlations)., CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Genetic variants identified in Europeans are associated with type 2 diabetes-related traits in Pakistanis, with comparable effect sizes. Larger studies are needed to perform adequately powered Mendelian randomisation and help dissect the relationships between type 2 diabetes-related traits in diverse South Asian subgroups.",Included,Included
22,Negative Effects of Age at Menarche on Risk of Cardiometabolic Diseases in Adulthood: A Mendelian Randomization Study,"CONTEXT: Observational studies have demonstrated that early menarche is associated with cardiometabolic diseases, but confounding factors make it difficult to infer causality., OBJECTIVE: We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to examine whether age at menarche (AAM) is causally associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary artery disease (CAD) and cardiometabolic traits., DESIGN AND METHODS: A 2-sample MR analysis was conducted using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from the Diabetes Genetics Replication and Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) consortium (n = 159 208) for T2D and the Coronary Artery Disease Genome-wide Replication and Meta-analysis plus the Coronary Artery Disease Genetics (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D) consortium (n = 184 305) for CAD. We used 122 instrumental variables (IVs) extracted from a published GWAS meta-analysis incorporating 182 416 women to determine the causal effect of AAM on cardiometabolic diseases, treating childhood and adult body mass index (BMI) as the confounders. Sensitivity analyses were also performed to detect the pleiotropy of the IVs., RESULTS: Employing the MR approach, we found that later AAM was associated with decreased risk of CAD (OR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.88-0.96]; P = 2.06 x 10-4) in adults, as well as lower blood levels of log fasting insulin, log homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), log HOMA of beta-cell function (HOMA-B), triglycerides, and diastolic blood pressure, but higher blood level of high-density lipoprotein. However, the associations were substantially attenuated after excluding BMI-related variants. MR analyses provide little evidence on the causal effect between AAM and T2D., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that AAM did not appear to have a causal effect on the risk of cardiometabolic diseases in adult life, as their associations observed in epidemiological studies might be largely mediated through excessive adiposity. We propose adiposity might be a primary target in future intervention strategy. Copyright ¬© Endocrine Society 2019. All rights reserved.

57,New strategies for the development of lipid-lowering therapies to reduce cardiovascular risk,"The very high occurrence of cardiovascular events presents a major public health issue, because treatment remains suboptimal. Lowering LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) with statins or ezetimibe in combination with a statin reduces major adverse cardiovascular events. The cardiovascular risk reduction in relation to the absolute LDL-C reduction is linear for most interventions without evidence of attenuation or increase in risk at low LDL-C levels. Opportunities for innovation in dyslipidaemia treatment should address the substantial risk of lipid-associated cardiovascular events among patients optimally treated per guidelines but who cannot achieve LDL-C goals and who could benefit from additional LDL-C-lowering therapy or experience side effects of statins. Fresh approaches are needed to identify promising drug targets early and develop them efficiently. The Cardiovascular Round Table of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) convened a workshop to discuss new lipid-lowering strategies for cardiovascular risk reduction. Opportunities to improve treatment approaches and the efficient study of new therapies were explored. Circulating biomarkers may not be fully reliable proxy indicators of the relationship between treatment effect and clinical outcome. Mendelian randomization studies may better inform development strategies and refine treatment targets before Phase 3. Trials should match the drug to appropriate lipid and patient profile, and guidelines may move towards a precision-based approach to individual patient management. Stakeholder collaboration is needed to ensure continued innovation and better international coordination of both regulatory aspects and guidelines. It should be noted that risk may also be addressed through increased attention to other risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, overweight, and inactivity.",Included,Included
40,Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease diagnoses and cardiovascular diseases: From epidemiology to drug approaches,"BACKGROUND: A consensus of experts has proposed to replace the term nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), whose global prevalence is 25%, with metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), to describe more appropriately the liver disease related to metabolic derangements. MAFLD is closely intertwined with type 2 diabetes, obesity, dyslipidaemia, all linked to a rise in the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVDs). Since controversy still stands on whether or not NAFLD/MAFLD raises the odds of CVD, the present review aims to evaluate the impact of NAFLD/MAFLD aetiologies on CV health and the potential correction by dietary and drug approaches., RESULTS: Epidemiological studies indicate that NAFLD raises risk of fatal or non-fatal CVD events. NAFLD patients have a higher prevalence of arterial plaques and stiffness, coronary calcification, and endothelial dysfunction. Although genetic and environmental factors strongly contribute to NAFLD pathogenesis, a Mendelian randomization analysis indicated that the PNPLA3 genetic variant leading to NAFLD may not be causally associated with CVD risk. Among other genetic variants related to NAFLD, TM6SF2 appears to be protective, whereas MBOAT7 may favour venous thromboembolism., CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD is correlated to a higher CVD risk which may be ameliorated by dietary interventions. This is not surprising, since new criteria defining MAFLD include other metabolic risk abnormalities fuelling development of serious adverse extrahepatic outcomes, for example CVD.

18,"Nonfasting glucose, ischemic heart disease, and myocardial infarction: a Mendelian randomization study","OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to test whether elevated nonfasting glucose levels associate with and cause ischemic heart disease (IHD) and myocardial infarction (MI)., BACKGROUND: Elevated fasting plasma glucose levels associate with increased risk of IHD, but whether this is also true for nonfasting levels and whether this is a causal relationship is unknown., METHODS: Using a Mendelian randomization approach, we studied 80,522 persons from Copenhagen, Denmark. Of those, IHD developed in 14,155, and MI developed in 6,257. Subjects were genotyped for variants in GCK (rs4607517), G6PC2 (rs560887), ADCY5 (rs11708067), DGKB (rs2191349), and ADRA2A (rs10885122) associated with elevated fasting glucose levels in genome-wide association studies., RESULTS: Risk of IHD and MI increased stepwise with increasing nonfasting glucose levels. The hazard ratio for IHD in subjects with nonfasting glucose levels >=11 mmol/l (>=198 mg/dl) versus <5 mmol/l (<90 mg/dl) was 6.9 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.2 to 11.2) adjusted for age and sex, and 2.3 (95% CI: 1.3 to 4.2) adjusted multifactorially; corresponding values for MI were 9.2 (95% CI: 4.6 to 18.2) and 4.8 (95% CI: 2.1 to 11.2). Increasing number of glucose-increasing alleles was associated with increasing nonfasting glucose levels and with increased risk of IHD and MI. The estimated causal odds ratio for IHD and MI by instrumental variable analysis for a 1-mmol/l (18-mg/dl) increase in nonfasting glucose levels due to genotypes combined were 1.25 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.52) and 1.69 (95% CI: 1.28 to 2.23), and the corresponding observed hazard ratio for IHD and MI by Cox regression was 1.18 (95% CI: 1.15 to 1.22) and 1.09 (95% CI: 1.07 to 1.11), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Like common nonfasting glucose elevation, plasma glucose-increasing polymorphisms associate with increased risk of IHD and MI. These data are compatible with a causal association. Copyright ¬© 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Included,Included
166,Novel loci for childhood body mass index and shared heritability with adult cardiometabolic traits,"The genetic background of childhood body mass index (BMI), and the extent to which the well-known associations of childhood BMI with adult diseases are explained by shared genetic factors, are largely unknown. We performed a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of BMI in 61,111 children aged between 2 and 10 years. Twenty-five independent loci reached genome-wide significance in the combined discovery and replication analyses. Two of these, located near NEDD4L and SLC45A3, have not previously been reported in relation to either childhood or adult BMI. Positive genetic correlations of childhood BMI with birth weight and adult BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, diastolic blood pressure and type 2 diabetes were detected (Rg ranging from 0.11 to 0.76, P-values <0.002). A negative genetic correlation of childhood BMI with age at menarche was observed. Our results suggest that the biological processes underlying childhood BMI largely, but not completely, overlap with those underlying adult BMI. The well-known observational associations of BMI in childhood with cardio-metabolic diseases in adulthood may reflect partial genetic overlap, but in light of previous evidence, it is also likely that they are explained through phenotypic continuity of BMI from childhood into adulthood.",Excluded,Excluded

74,Obesity and peripheral arterial disease: A Mendelian Randomization analysis,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Observational studies showed that obesity is a major risk factor for peripheral arterial disease (PAD). However, conventional epidemiology studies are vulnerable to residual bias from confounding factors. We aimed to explore the causality of obesity in development of PAD using Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach., METHODS: A MR analysis was performed in 11,477 community-dwelling adults aged 40 years and above recruited from two nearby communities during 2011-2013 in Shanghai, China. We genotyped 14 body mass index (BMI) associated common variants identified and validated in East Asians. PAD was defined as ankle-to-brachial index (ABI) <0.90 or >1.40. Weighted BMI genetic risk score (GRS) was used as the Instrumental Variable (IV)., RESULTS: After adjusted for confounding factors, we found that each standard deviation (SD, 2.76 points) increase in BMI-GRS was associated with 0.43 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.36-0.49) kg/m(2) increase in BMI (P < 0.0001) and an odds ratio (OR) for PAD of 1.17 (95% CI: 1.07-1.27; P = 0.0004). Compared with the lowest quartile of BMI-GRS, the second, third and highest quartile associated with 9%, 19% and 45% increment of PAD risk, respectively (P for trend = 0.002). In the MR analysis, we demonstrated a causal relationship between obesity and PAD (OR = 1.44 per BMI-unit, 95% CI: 1.18-1.75; P = 0.0003)., CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that obesity may be causally associated with PAD after controlling for the potential intermediate factors like hypertension, dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia.

174,On the Use of the Lasso for Instrumental Variables Estimation with Some Invalid Instruments,"We investigate the behavior of the Lasso for selecting invalid instruments in linear instrumental variables models for estimating causal effects of exposures on outcomes, as proposed recently by Kang et al. Invalid instruments are such that they fail the exclusion restriction and enter the model as explanatory variables. We show that for this setup, the Lasso may not consistently select the invalid instruments if these are relatively strong. We propose a median estimator that is consistent when less than 50% of the instruments are invalid, and its consistency does not depend on the relative strength of the instruments, or their correlation structure. We show that this estimator can be used for adaptive Lasso estimation, with the resulting estimator having oracle properties. The methods are applied to a Mendelian randomization study to estimate the causal effect of body mass index (BMI) on diastolic blood pressure, using data on individuals from the UK Biobank, with 96 single nucleotide polymorphisms as potential instruments for BMI.

118,Phenome-wide Mendelian-randomization study of genetically determined vitamin D on multiple health outcomes using the UK Biobank study,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent across the globe. Existing studies suggest that a low vitamin D level is associated with more than 130 outcomes. Exploring the causal role of vitamin D in health outcomes could support or question vitamin D supplementation., METHODS: We carried out a systematic literature review of previous Mendelian-randomization studies on vitamin D. We then implemented a Mendelian Randomization-Phenome Wide Association Study (MR-PheWAS) analysis on data from 339 256 individuals of White British origin from UK Biobank. We first ran a PheWAS analysis to test the associations between a 25(OH)D polygenic risk score and 920 disease outcomes, and then nine phenotypes (i.e. systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, risk of hypertension, T2D, ischaemic heart disease, body mass index, depression, non-vertebral fracture and all-cause mortality) that met the pre-defined inclusion criteria for further analysis were examined by multiple MR analytical approaches to explore causality., RESULTS: The PheWAS analysis did not identify any health outcome associated with the 25(OH)D polygenic risk score. Although a selection of nine outcomes were reported in previous Mendelian-randomization studies or umbrella reviews to be associated with vitamin D, our MR analysis, with substantial study power (>80% power to detect an association with an odds ratio >1.2 for per standard deviation increase of log-transformed 25[OH]D), was unable to support an interpretation of causal association., CONCLUSIONS: We investigated the putative causal effects of vitamin D on multiple health outcomes in a White population. We did not support a causal effect on any of the disease outcomes tested. However, we cannot exclude small causal effects or effects on outcomes that we did not have enough power to explore due to the small number of cases. Copyright ¬© The Author(s) 2019.

39,Phenome-wide investigation of the causal associations between childhood BMI and adult trait outcomes: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study,"BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity is reported to be associated with the risk of many diseases in adulthood. However, observational studies cannot fully account for confounding factors. We aimed to systematically assess the causal associations between childhood body mass index (BMI) and various adult traits/diseases using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR)., METHODS: After data filtering, 263 adult traits genetically correlated with childhood BMI (P < 0.05) were subjected to MR analyses. Inverse-variance weighted, MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode methods were used to estimate the causal effects. Multivariable MR analysis was performed to test whether the effects of childhood BMI on adult traits are independent from adult BMI., RESULTS: We identified potential causal effects of childhood obesity on 60 adult traits (27 disease-related traits, 27 lifestyle factors, and 6 other traits). Higher childhood BMI was associated with a reduced overall health rating (beta = - 0.10, 95% CI - 0.13 to - 0.07, P = 6.26 x 10-11). Specifically, higher childhood BMI was associated with increased odds of coronary artery disease (OR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.11, P = 4.28 x 10-11), essential hypertension (OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.16, P = 1.27 x 10-11), type 2 diabetes (OR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.43, P = 1.57 x 10-34), and arthrosis (OR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.12, P = 8.80 x 10-9). However, after accounting for adult BMI, the detrimental effects of childhood BMI on disease-related traits were no longer present (P > 0.05). For dietary habits, different from conventional understanding, we found that higher childhood BMI was associated with low calorie density food intake. However, this association might be specific to the UK Biobank population., CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we provided a phenome-wide view of the effects of childhood BMI on adult traits. Multivariable MR analysis suggested that the associations between childhood BMI and increased risks of diseases in adulthood are likely attributed to individuals remaining obese in later life. Therefore, ensuring that childhood obesity does not persist into later life might be useful for reducing the detrimental effects of childhood obesity on adult diseases.",Included,Included
134,Plasma Circulating Vitamin C Levels and Risk of Endometrial Cancer: A Bi-Directional Mendelian Randomization Analysis,"Background: Observational studies indicated that circulating vitamin C (VitC) levels may be correlated with the risk of endometrial cancer (EC). However, the causal effects and direction between them were still unclear., Methods: In this study, 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) robustly correlated with plasma VitC levels were extracted from the latest genome-wide association study (GWAS), containing 52,018 individuals. Genetic data of EC were obtained from the Endometrial Cancer Association Consortium (ECAC) (12,906 cases and 108,979 controls). An inverse-variance weighted method was utilized as the primary analysis of Mendelian randomization (MR), supplemented by the weighted median, MR Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier test (MR-PRESSO), and MR-Egger methods. Additional sensitivity analyses excluding 3 SNPs with secondary phenotypes were conducted to rule out the possible pleiotropic effects. Potential impacts of several risk factors of EC, such as obesity, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, and diabetes on VitC levels, were assessed. We additionally evaluated the effects of VitC on LDL cholesterol levels, HDL cholesterol levels, and triglycerides levels to probe into the possible mediators in the VitC-EC pathway., Results: Genetically predicted higher plasma VitC levels (per 1 SD increase, approximately 20 mumol/L) were causally associated with an increased risk of EC overall [odds ratio (OR) 1.374, 95% CI 1.128-1.674, p = 0.0016], supported by complementary sensitivity analyses. In the subgroup analyses, genetically predicted higher levels of VitC were associated with a tendency of increased risks of both endometrioid (OR SD 1.324, 95% CI 0.959-1.829, p = 0.0881) and non-endometrioid histology (OR SD 1.392, 95% CI 0.873-2.220, p = 0.1647) while without statistical significance. The association remained significant after the exclusion of the three pleiotropic SNPs (OR SD 1.394, 95% CI 1.090-1.784, p = 0.0082). The confounders and mediators were unlikely to affect the VitC-EC relationship. The causal effect of EC on VitC levels was not supported (OR 1.001, 95% CI 0.998-1.004, p = 0.4468)., Conclusions: This bi-directional MR study demonstrated a causal risk role of higher circulating VitC at physiological levels on an increased risk of EC, which was independent of confounders and mediators. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the possible mechanisms. Copyright ¬© 2022 Peng, Wu and Wen.",Included,Included
38,Polygenic risk score identifies associations between sleep duration and diseases determined from an electronic medical record biobank,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: We aimed to detect cross-sectional phenotype and polygenic risk score (PRS) associations between sleep duration and prevalent diseases using the Partners Biobank, a hospital-based cohort study linking electronic medical records (EMR) with genetic information., METHODS: Disease prevalence was determined from EMR, and sleep duration was self-reported. A PRS for sleep duration was derived using 78 previously associated SNPs from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for self-reported sleep duration. We tested for associations between (1) self-reported sleep duration and 22 prevalent diseases (n = 30 251), (2) the PRS and self-reported sleep duration (n = 6903), and (3) the PRS and the 22 prevalent diseases (n = 16 033). For observed PRS-disease associations, we tested causality using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR)., RESULTS: In the age-, sex-, and race-adjusted model, U-shaped associations were observed for sleep duration and asthma, depression, hypertension, insomnia, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and type 2 diabetes, where both short and long sleepers had higher odds for these diseases than normal sleepers (p < 2.27 x 10-3). Next, we confirmed associations between the PRS and longer sleep duration (0.65 +/- 0.19 SD minutes per effect allele; p = 7.32 x 10-04). The PRS collectively explained 1.4% of the phenotypic variance in sleep duration. After adjusting for age, sex, genotyping array, and principal components of ancestry, we observed that the PRS was also associated with congestive heart failure (CHF; p = 0.015), obesity (p = 0.019), hypertension (p = 0.039), restless legs syndrome (RLS; p = 0.041), and insomnia (p = 0.049). Associations were maintained following additional adjustment for obesity status, except for hypertension and insomnia. For all diseases, except RLS, carrying a higher genetic burden of the 78 sleep duration-increasing alleles (i.e. higher sleep duration PRS) associated with lower odds for prevalent disease. In MR, we estimated causal associations between genetically defined longer sleep duration with decreased risk of CHF (inverse variance weighted [IVW] OR per minute of sleep [95% CI] = 0.978 [0.961-0.996]; p = 0.019) and hypertension (IVW OR [95% CI] = 0.993 [0.986-1.000]; p = 0.049), and increased risk of RLS (IVW OR [95% CI] = 1.018 [1.000-1.036]; p = 0.045)., CONCLUSIONS: By validating the PRS for sleep duration and identifying cross-phenotype associations, we lay the groundwork for future investigations on the intersection between sleep, genetics, clinical measures, and diseases using large EMR datasets.

102,Relation of age-related cataract with obesity and obesity genes in an Asian population,"Obesity shows an inconsistent association with cataract. Causality has not been established. Polymorphisms at the fat mass- and obesity-associated (FTO) locus are associated with obesity and offer an opportunity to examine the obesity-cataract association using a mendelian randomization approach. The authors conducted a population-based study among Singaporean Malay adults (2004-2006) in which nuclear, cortical, and posterior subcapsular (PSC) cataracts were assessed and defined by slit-lamp examination using Lens Opacity Classification System III. Obesity was defined as body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) > or =30. The study included 3,000 subjects, of whom 1,339 (44.6%) had cataract (848 (28.3%) nuclear, 939 (31.3%) cortical, and 285 (9.5%) PSC). After multivariable adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and education, obesity was significantly associated with cortical (odds ratio (OR) = 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 1.71) and PSC (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.10, 2.32) cataracts but not nuclear cataract. FTO single nucleotide polymorphisms known to be associated with obesity in this study population were not associated with cortical or PSC cataract but were associated with nuclear cataract (OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.58), even in multivariate analyses controlling additionally for body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking (OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.55). These results do not support a causal association between obesity and cortical or PSC cataract. The FTO gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of nuclear cataract.",Included,Included
197,"Relationship between alcohol use, blood pressure and hypertension: an association study and a Mendelian randomisation study","BACKGROUND: Past studies have found a strong relationship between alcohol drinking and human health., METHODS: In this study, we first tested the association of rs671 with alcohol use in 2349 participants in southeast China. We then evaluated the causal impact between alcohol use and cardiovascular traits through a Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis., RESULTS: We found strong evidence for the association of rs671 in the ALDH2 gene with alcohol drinking (p=6.08x10-47; ORadj G=4.50, 95% CI 3.67 to 5.52). We found that female G carriers of rs671 had a higher proportion of non-drinkers than male G carriers (88.01% vs 38.70%). In non-drinkers, the female G allele frequency was higher than the male G allele frequency (71.1% vs 55.2%). MR analysis suggested that alcohol use had a causal effect on blood pressure (increasing 9.46 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure (p=9.67x10-4) and 7.50 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure (p=9.62x10-5)), and on hypertension in men (p=0.011; OR =1.19, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.36) and in pooled samples (p=0.013; OR =1.20, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.39), but not in women. We did not observe a causal effect of alcohol use on body mass index and lipid levels; further studies are needed to clarify the non-causal relationship., CONCLUSIONS: Compared to never-drinkers, current and previous alcohol use had a causal effect on blood pressure and hypertension in pooled samples and in men.

92,"Relative Deprivation, Income Inequality, and Cardiovascular Health: Observational and Mendelian Randomization Studies in Hong Kong Chinese","The associations between absolute vs. relative income at the household or neighborhood level and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk remain understudied in the Chinese context. Further, it is unclear whether stress biomarkers, such as cortisol, are on the pathway from income to CVD risk. We examined the associations of absolute and relative income with CVD risk observationally, as well as the mediating role of cortisol, and validated the role of cortisol using Mendelian Randomization (MR) in Hong Kong Chinese. Within Hong Kong's FAMILY Cohort, associations of absolute and relative income at both the individual and neighborhood levels with CVD risk [body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, self-reported CVD and self-reported diabetes] were examined using multilevel logistic or linear models (n = 17,607), the mediating role of cortisol using the mediation analysis (n = 1,562), and associations of genetically predicted cortisol with CVD risk using the multiplicative generalized method of moments (MGMMs) or two-stage least squares regression (n = 1,562). In our cross-sectional observational analysis, relative household income deprivation (per 1 SD, equivalent to USD 128 difference in Yitzhaki index) was associated with higher systolic blood pressure (0.47 mmHg, 95% CI 0.30-0.64), but lower BMI (-0.07 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.11 to -0.04), independent of absolute income. Neighborhood income inequality was generally unrelated to CVD and its risk factors, nor was absolute income at the household or neighborhood level. Cortisol did not clearly mediate the association of relative household income deprivation with systolic blood pressure. Using MR, cortisol was unrelated to CVD risk. Based on our findings, relative household income deprivation was not consistently associated with cardiovascular health in Hong Kong Chinese, nor were neighborhood income inequality and absolute income, highlighting the context-specific ways in which relative and absolute income are linked to CVD risk.

163,"Remnant cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and blood pressure as mediators from obesity to ischemic heart disease","RATIONALE: Obesity leads to increased ischemic heart disease (IHD) risk, but the risk is thought to be mediated through intermediate variables and may not be caused by increased weight per se., OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that the increased IHD risk because of obesity is mediated through lipoproteins, blood pressure, glucose, and C-reactive protein., METHODS AND RESULTS: Approximately 90 000 participants from Copenhagen were included in a Mendelian randomization design with mediation analyses. Associations were examined using conventional measurements of body mass index and intermediate variables and using genetic variants associated with these. During <=22 years of follow-up 13 945 participants developed IHD. The increased IHD risk caused by obesity was partly mediated through elevated levels of nonfasting remnant cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, through elevated blood pressure, and possibly also through elevated nonfasting glucose levels; however, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated C-reactive protein levels were not mediators in genetic analyses. The 3 intermediate variables that explained the highest excess risk of IHD from genetically determined obesity were low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with 8%, systolic blood pressure with 7%, and remnant cholesterol with 7% excess risk of IHD. Corresponding observational excess risks using conventional body mass index were 21%, 11%, and 20%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The increased IHD risk because of obesity was partly mediated through elevated levels of nonfasting remnant and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and through elevated blood pressure. Our results suggest that there may be benefit to gain by reducing levels of these risk factors in obese individuals not able to achieve sustained weight loss.

Many non-genetic risk factors have been suggested, but their overall epidemiological credibility has not been assessed., METHODS: We searched PubMed to capture all meta-analyses and Mendelian randomization studies for risk factors of T2DM. For each association, we estimated the summary effect size, its 95% confidence and prediction interval, and the I2 metric. We examined the presence of small-study effects and excess significance bias. We assessed the epidemiological credibility through a set of predefined criteria., RESULTS: We captured 86 eligible papers (142 associations) covering a wide range of biomarkers, medical conditions, and dietary, lifestyle, environmental and psychosocial factors. Adiposity, low hip circumference, serum biomarkers (increased level of alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, uric acid and C-reactive protein, and decreased level of adiponectin and vitamin D), an unhealthy dietary pattern (increased consumption of processed meat and sugar-sweetened beverages, decreased intake of whole grains, coffee and heme iron, and low adherence to a healthy dietary pattern), low level of education and conscientiousness, decreased physical activity, high sedentary time and duration of television watching, low alcohol drinking, smoking, air pollution, and some medical conditions (high systolic blood pressure, late menarche age, gestational diabetes, metabolic syndrome, preterm birth) presented robust evidence for increased risk of T2DM., CONCLUSIONS: A healthy lifestyle pattern could lead to decreased risk for T2DM.

54,Risk factors mediating the effect of body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio on cardiovascular outcomes: Mendelian randomization analysis,"BACKGROUND: Higher body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, but the extent to which this is mediated by blood pressure, diabetes, lipid traits, and smoking is not fully understood., METHODS: Using consortia and UK Biobank genetic association summary data from 140,595 to 898,130 participants predominantly of European ancestry, Mendelian randomization mediation analysis was performed to investigate the degree to which systolic blood pressure (SBP), diabetes, lipid traits, and smoking mediated an effect of BMI and WHR on the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD) and stroke., RESULTS: The odds ratio of CAD per 1-standard deviation increase in genetically predicted BMI was 1.49 (95% CI 1.39 to 1.60). This attenuated to 1.34 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.45) after adjusting for genetically predicted SBP (proportion mediated 27%, 95% CI 3% to 50%), to 1.27 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.37) after adjusting for genetically predicted diabetes (41% mediated, 95% CI 18% to 63%), to 1.47 (95% CI 1.36 to 1.59) after adjusting for genetically predicted lipids (3% mediated, 95% -23% to 29%), and to 1.46 (95% CI 1.34 to 1.58) after adjusting for genetically predicted smoking (6% mediated, 95% CI -20% to 32%). Adjusting for all the mediators together, the estimate attenuated to 1.14 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.26; 66% mediated, 95% CI 42% to 91%). A similar pattern was observed when considering genetically predicted WHR as the exposure, and PAD or stroke as the outcome., CONCLUSIONS: Measures to reduce obesity will lower the risk of cardiovascular disease primarily by impacting downstream metabolic risk factors, particularly diabetes and hypertension. Reduction of obesity prevalence alongside control and management of its mediators is likely to be most effective for minimizing the burden of obesity.",Included,Included
47,Risk of lower respiratory tract infections: a genome-wide association study with Mendelian randomization analysis in three independent European populations,"OBJECTIVE: Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Few studies have previously investigated genetic susceptibility and potential risk factors for LRTI., METHODS: We used data from the UK Biobank, Trondelag Health Study (HUNT), and FinnGen to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Cases were subjects hospitalized with LRTI, and controls were subjects with no such hospitalization. We conducted stratification and interaction analyses to evaluate whether the genetic effect of LRTI differed by sex or smoking. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted to identify the unconfounded relationship between cardiometabolic risk factors and LRTI., RESULTS: A total of 25 320 cases and 575 294 controls were included. The 15q25.1 locus reached genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis (rs10519203: OR 0.94, p 3.87e-11). The protective effect of effect allele of rs10519203 was present among smokers (OR 0.90, 95%CI 0.87-0.92, p 1.38e-15) but not among never-smokers (OR 1.01, 95%CI 0.97-1.06, p 5.20e-01). In MR analyses, we found that increasing body mass index (OR 1.31, 95%CI 1.24-1.40, p 3.78e-18), lifetime smoking (OR 2.83, 95%CI 2.34-3.42, p 6.56e-27), and systolic blood pressure robustly increased the risk of LRTIs (OR 1.11, 95%CI 1.02-1.22, p 1.48e-02)., CONCLUSION: A region in 15q25.1 was strongly associated with LRTI susceptibility. Reduction in the prevalence of smoking, overweight, obesity, and hypertension may reduce the disease burden of LRTIs. Copyright ¬© 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

34,"Robust Mendelian randomization in the presence of residual population stratification, batch effects and horizontal pleiotropy","Mendelian Randomization (MR) studies are threatened by population stratification, batch effects, and horizontal pleiotropy. Although a variety of methods have been proposed to mitigate those problems, residual biases may still remain, leading to highly statistically significant false positives in large databases. Here we describe a suite of sensitivity analysis tools that enables investigators to quantify the robustness of their findings against such validity threats. Specifically, we propose the routine reporting of sensitivity statistics that reveal the minimal strength of violations necessary to explain away the MR results. We further provide intuitive displays of the robustness of the MR estimate to any degree of violation, and formal bounds on the worst-case bias caused by violations multiple times stronger than observed variables. We demonstrate how these tools can aid researchers in distinguishing robust from fragile findings by examining the effect of body mass index on diastolic blood pressure and Townsend deprivation index.

Alternatively, reciprocal Mendelian randomization (MR) can be applied, which however may perform poorly in the presence of (unknown) invalid IVs, especially for bi-directional causal relationships. In this paper, first, we propose a CD method that performs better than existing CD methods regardless of the presence of correlated pleiotropy. Second, along with a simple but yet effective IV screening rule, we propose applying a closely related and state-of-the-art MR method in reciprocal MR, showing its almost identical performance to that of the new CD method when their model assumptions hold; however, if the modeling assumptions are violated, the new CD method is expected to better control type I errors. Notably bi-directional causal relationships impose some unique challenges beyond those for uni-directional ones, and thus requiring special treatments. For example, we point out for the first time several scenarios where a bi-directional relationship, but not a uni-directional one, can unexpectedly cause the violation of some weak modeling assumptions commonly required by many robust MR methods. We also offer some numerical support and a modeling justification for the application of our new methods (and more generally MR) to binary traits. Finally we applied the proposed methods to 12 risk factors and 4 common diseases, confirming mostly well-known uni-directional causal relationships, while identifying some novel and plausible bi-directional ones such as between body mass index and type 2 diabetes (T2D), and between diastolic blood pressure and stroke.",Included,Included
30,"Roles of Cardiometabolic Factors in Mediating the Causal Effect of Type 2 Diabetes on Cardiovascular Diseases: A Two-Step, Two-Sample Multivariable Mendelian Randomization Study","Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate the roles of cardiometabolic factors (including blood pressure, blood lipids, thyroid function, body mass, and insulin sensitivity) in mediating the causal effect of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) on cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes., Design: Two-step, two-sample multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) study., Setting: International genome-wide association study (GWAS) consortia data., Exposure: Type 2 diabetes, blood pressure: systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP); blood lipids: low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG); thyroid function: hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism; body mass index (BMI), waist-hip-ratio (WHR), and insulin sensitivity., Main Outcomes: Cardiovascular disease includes coronary heart disease (CHD), myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke., Methods: Summary-level data for exposures and main outcomes were extracted from GWAS consortia. We used two-sample MR to illustrate the causal effect of T2DM on CVD subtypes and regression-based MVMR to quantify the possible mediation effects of cardiometabolic factors on CVD., Results: Each additional unit of log odds of T2DM increased 16% risk of CHD [odds ratio (OR): 1.16, 95% CI: 1.12-1.21], 15% risk of myocardial infarction (MI) (OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.10-1.20), and 10% risk of stroke (OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.06-1.13). In mediation analysis, SBP, DBP, and TG were found as main mediators, while the mediation effects of other cardiometabolic factors were not significant. The proportion of total effect of T2DM on CHD mediated by SBP, DBP, and TG was 16% (95% CI: 8-24%), 7% (95% CI: 1-13%) and 10% (95% CI: 2-18%), respectively. Mediation effect of SBP and DBP on MI and stroke, TG on MI was also prominent, while mediation effect of TG on stroke was not significant. The combined mediation effect of all the three mediators accounted for 29%, 26%, and 13% of the total effect of T2DM on CHD, MI, and stroke, respectively., Conclusion: Systolic blood pressure, DBP, and TG mediate a substantial proportion of the causal effect of T2DM on CVD and thus interventions on these factors might reduce the considerable excess risk of CVD among patients with T2DM.

119,"Searching for the causal effects of body mass index in over 300 000 participants in UK Biobank, using Mendelian randomization","Mendelian randomization (MR) has been used to estimate the causal effect of body mass index (BMI) on particular traits thought to be affected by BMI. However, BMI may also be a modifiable, causal risk factor for outcomes where there is no prior reason to suggest that a causal effect exists. We performed a MR phenome-wide association study (MR-pheWAS) to search for the causal effects of BMI in UK Biobank (n = 334 968), using the PHESANT open-source phenome scan tool. A subset of identified associations were followed up with a formal two-stage instrumental variable analysis in UK Biobank, to estimate the causal effect of BMI on these phenotypes. Of the 22 922 tests performed, our MR-pheWAS identified 587 associations below a stringent P value threshold corresponding to a 5% estimated false discovery rate. These included many previously identified causal effects, for instance, an adverse effect of higher BMI on risk of diabetes and hypertension. We also identified several novel effects, including protective effects of higher BMI on a set of psychosocial traits, identified initially in our preliminary MR-pheWAS in circa 115,000 UK Biobank participants and replicated in a different subset of circa 223,000 UK Biobank participants. Our comprehensive MR-pheWAS identified potential causal effects of BMI on a large and diverse set of phenotypes. This included both previously identified causal effects, and novel effects such as a protective effect of higher BMI on feelings of nervousness.",Included,Included
147,Semiparametric methods for estimation of a nonlinear exposure-outcome relationship using instrumental variables with application to Mendelian randomization,"Mendelian randomization, the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables (IV), can test for and estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome. Most IV methods assume that the function relating the exposure to the expected value of the outcome (the exposure-outcome relationship) is linear. However, in practice, this assumption may not hold. Indeed, often the primary question of interest is to assess the shape of this relationship. We present two novel IV methods for investigating the shape of the exposure-outcome relationship: a fractional polynomial method and a piecewise linear method. We divide the population into strata using the exposure distribution, and estimate a causal effect, referred to as a localized average causal effect (LACE), in each stratum of population. The fractional polynomial method performs metaregression on these LACE estimates. The piecewise linear method estimates a continuous piecewise linear function, the gradient of which is the LACE estimate in each stratum. Both methods were demonstrated in a simulation study to estimate the true exposure-outcome relationship well, particularly when the relationship was a fractional polynomial (for the fractional polynomial method) or was piecewise linear (for the piecewise linear method). The methods were used to investigate the shape of relationship of body mass index with systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure.

115,Serum uric acid levels and cardiovascular disease: the Gordian knot,"Hyperuricemia is defined as serum uric acid level of more than 7 mg/dL and blood levels of uric acid are causally associated with gout, as implicated by evidence from randomized clinical trials using urate lowering therapies. Uric acid as a cardiovascular risk factor often accompanies metabolic syndrome, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, chronic renal disease, and obesity. Despite the association of hyperuricemia with cardiovascular risk factors, it has remained controversial as to whether uric acid is an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease. To settle this issue, and in the absence of large randomized controlled trials, Mendelian randomization analysis in which the exposure is defined based on the presence or absence of a specific allele that influences a risk factor of interest have tried to shed light on this.",Excluded,Excluded
7,Shared genetic components between metabolic syndrome and schizophrenia: Genetic correlation using multipopulation data sets,"AIM: The genetic relationship between schizophrenia (SCZ) and other nonpsychiatric disorders remains largely unknown. We examined the shared genetic components between these disorders based on multipopulation data sets., METHODS: We used two data sets for East Asian (EAS) and European (EUR) samples. SCZ data was based on the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Asia with our own genome-wide association study for EAS and Psychiatric Genomics Consortium for EUR. Nonpsychiatric data (20 binary traits [mainly nonpsychiatric complex disorders] and 34 quantitative traits [mainly laboratory examinations and physical characteristics]) were obtained from Biobank Japan and UK Biobank for EAS and EUR samples, respectively. To evaluate genetic correlation, linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis was utilized with further meta-analysis for each result from EAS and EUR samples to obtain robust evidence. Subsequent mendelian randomization analysis was also included to examine the causal effect., RESULTS: A significant genetic correlation between SCZ and several metabolic syndrome (MetS) traits was detected in the combined samples (meta-analysis between EAS and EUR data) (body mass index [rg = -0.10, q-value = 1.0 x 10-9 ], high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol [rg = 0.072, q-value = 2.9 x 10-3 ], blood sugar [rg = -0.068, q-value = 1.4 x 10-2 ], triglycerides [rg = -0.052, q-value = 2.4 x 10-2 ], systolic blood pressure [rg = -0.054, q-value = 3.5 x 10-2 ], and C-reactive protein [rg = -0.076, q-value = 7.8 x 10-5 ]. However, no causal relationship on SCZ susceptibility was detected for these traits based on the mendelian randomization analysis., CONCLUSION: Our results indicate shared genetic components between SCZ and MetS traits and C-reactive protein. Specifically, we found it interesting that the correlation between MetS traits and SCZ was the opposite of that expected from clinical studies: this genetic study suggests that SCZ susceptibility was associated with reduced MetS. This implied that MetS in patients with SCZ was not associated with genetic components but with environmental factors, including antipsychotics, lifestyle changes, poor diet, lack of exercise, and living conditions.

14,Systematic evaluation of the association between hemoglobin levels and metabolic profile implicates beneficial effects of hypoxia,"Activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway reprograms energy metabolism. Hemoglobin (Hb) is the main carrier of oxygen. Using its normal variation as a surrogate measure for hypoxia, we explored whether lower Hb levels could lead to healthier metabolic profiles in mice and humans (n = 7175) and used Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate potential causality (n = 173,480). The results showed evidence for lower Hb levels being associated with lower body mass index, better glucose tolerance and other metabolic profiles, lower inflammatory load, and blood pressure. Expression of the key HIF target genes SLC2A4 and Slc2a1 in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, respectively, associated with systolic blood pressure in MR analyses and body weight, liver weight, and adiposity in mice. Last, manipulation of murine Hb levels mediated changes to key metabolic parameters. In conclusion, low-end normal Hb levels may be favorable for metabolic health involving mild chronic activation of the HIF response.

182,The Association of Obstructive Sleep Apnea With Breast Cancer Incidence and Mortality: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"PURPOSE: Emerging evidence from animal models suggests that intermittent hypoxia due to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor for breast cancer. Despite their biological plausibility, human epidemiological studies have reported conflicting results. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to delineate this relationship., METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases for eligible studies from inception until June 6, 2021. Two reviewers selected randomized trials or observational studies reporting the association between OSA and breast cancer incidence compared with those without OSA. Two reviewers extracted relevant data and assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). We pooled the maximally covariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) using a random-effects inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis and performed pre-specified subgroup analyses., RESULTS: We included six studies out of 1,707 records, comprising a combined cohort of 5,165,200 patients. All studies used the International Classification of Diseases codes to classify OSA and breast cancer. OSA patients had a 36% increased breast cancer risk (HR, 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.80; N = 6, I2 = 96%) compared to those without OSA. Most studies adjusted for confounders, such as age, sex, obesity, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use, and hypertension. Subgroup analyses for studies with (1) multivariate adjustment and (2) at least five years of follow-up yielded HRs of 1.35 (95% CI, 0.98-1.87; N = 5, I2 = 96%) and 1.57 (95% CI, 1.14-2.18; N = 4; I2 = 90%), respectively. One Mendelian randomization study suggested a causal relationship, with a two-fold increase in the odds of breast cancer in patients with OSA., CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggested that OSA is a risk factor for breast cancer. Future studies should explore the dose-response relationship between OSA and breast cancer, and whether treatment may mitigate breast cancer risk or progression.

23,"The Role of Obesity, Type 2 Diabetes, and Metabolic Factors in Pancreatic Cancer: A Mendelian Randomization Study","Background: Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include a cluster of metabolic conditions such as obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Given that these risk factors are correlated, separating out causal from confounded effects is challenging. Mendelian randomization (MR), or the use of genetic instrumental variables, may facilitate the identification of the metabolic drivers of pancreatic cancer., Methods: We identified genetic instruments for obesity, body shape, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes in order to evaluate their causal role in pancreatic cancer etiology. These instruments were analyzed in relation to risk using a likelihood-based MR approach within a series of 7110 pancreatic cancer patients and 7264 control subjects using genome-wide data from the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium (PanScan) and the Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control Consortium (PanC4). Potential unknown pleiotropic effects were assessed using a weighted median approach and MR-Egger sensitivity analyses., Results: Results indicated a robust causal association of increasing body mass index (BMI) with pancreatic cancer risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09 to 1.65, for each standard deviation increase in BMI [4.6 kg/m2]). There was also evidence that genetically increased fasting insulin levels were causally associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.05 to 2.63, per SD [44.4 pmol/L]). Notably, no evidence of a causal relationship was observed for type 2 diabetes, nor for dyslipidemia. Sensitivity analyses did not indicate that pleiotropy was an important source of bias., Conclusions: Our results suggest a causal role of BMI and fasting insulin in pancreatic cancer etiology.

8,The association between cardiovascular risk factors and major cardiovascular diseases decreases with increasing frailty levels in geriatric outpatients,"BACKGROUND: Frailty marks a process of increasing dysregulation of physiological systems which increases the risk of adverse health outcomes. This study examines the hypothesis that the association between multiple cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) becomes stronger with increasing frailty severity., METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of 339 older adults (55.2% women; aged 75.2+/-9.1years) from an outpatient geriatric clinic from a middle-income country. The frailty index (FI) was calculated as the proportion of 30 possible health deficits. We assessed hypertension, diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, sedentarism and smoking as CVRF (determinants) and myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure as CVD. Poisson regression models adjusted for age, sex, and education was applied to estimate the association between frailty as well as CVRF (independent variables) with CVD (dependent variable)., RESULTS: Of the 339 patients, 18,3% were frail (FI>=0.25) and 32.7% had at least one CVD. Both frailty and CVRF were significantly associated with CVD (PR=1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05; p=0.001, and PR=1.46, 95% 1.24 to 1.71; p<0.001, respectively) adjusted for covariates. The strength of the association between CVRF and CVD decreased with increasing frailty levels, as indicated by a significant interaction term of frailty and CVRF (p<0.001)., CONCLUSION: Frailty and CVRF are both associated with CVD, but the impact of CVRF decreases in the presence of frailty. When confirmed in longitudinal studies, randomized controlled trials or causal inference methods like Mendelian randomization should be applied to assess whether a shift from traditional CVRF to frailty would improve cardiovascular outcome in the oldest old.

112,The association between mitochondrial DNA abundance and stroke: A combination of multivariable-adjusted survival and Mendelian randomization analyses,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are thought to drive disease risk, including stroke. We investigated the association between mtDNA abundance, as a proxy measure of mitochondrial function, and incident stroke, using multivariable-adjusted survival and Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses., METHODS: Cox-proportional hazard model analyses were conducted to assess the association between mtDNA abundance, and incident ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke over a maximum of 14-year follow-up in European-ancestry participants from UK Biobank. MR was conducted using independent (R2 < 0.001) lead variants for mtDNA abundance (p < 5 x 10-8) as instrumental variables. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-ischemic stroke associations were derived from three published open source European-ancestry results databases (cases/controls): MEGASTROKE (60,341/454,450), UK Biobank (2404/368,771) and FinnGen (10,551/202,223). MR was performed per study, and results were subsequently meta-analyzed., RESULTS: In total, 288,572 unrelated participants (46% men) with mean (SD) age of 57 (8) years were included in the Cox-proportional hazard analyses. After correction for considered confounders (BMI, hypertension, cholesterol, T2D), no association was found between low versus high mtDNA abundance and ischemic (HR: 1.06 [95% CI: 0.95, 1.18]) or hemorrhagic (HR: 0.97 [95% CI: 0.82, 1.15]) stroke. However, in the MR analyses after removal of platelet count-associated SNPs, we found evidence for an association between genetically-influenced mtDNA abundance and ischemic stroke (odds ratio, 1.17; confidence interval, 1.03, 1.32)., CONCLUSIONS: Although the results from both multivariable-adjusted prospective and basis MR analyses did not show an association between low mtDNA and increased risk of ischemic stroke, in-depth MR sensitivity analyses may suggest evidence for a causal relationship.

98,The causal effect of vitamin D binding protein (DBP) levels on calcemic and cardiometabolic diseases: a Mendelian randomization study,"BACKGROUND: Observational studies have shown that vitamin D binding protein (DBP) levels, a key determinant of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25OHD) levels, and 25OHD levels themselves both associate with risk of disease. If 25OHD levels have a causal influence on disease, and DBP lies in this causal pathway, then DBP levels should likewise be causally associated with disease. We undertook a Mendelian randomization study to determine whether DBP levels have causal effects on common calcemic and cardiometabolic disease., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We measured DBP and 25OHD levels in 2,254 individuals, followed for up to 10 y, in the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos). Using the single nucleotide polymorphism rs2282679 as an instrumental variable, we applied Mendelian randomization methods to determine the causal effect of DBP on calcemic (osteoporosis and hyperparathyroidism) and cardiometabolic diseases (hypertension, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, and stroke) and related traits, first in CaMos and then in large-scale genome-wide association study consortia. The effect allele was associated with an age- and sex-adjusted decrease in DBP level of 27.4 mg/l (95% CI 24.7, 30.0; n = 2,254). DBP had a strong observational and causal association with 25OHD levels (p = 3.2 x 10(-19)). While DBP levels were observationally associated with calcium and body mass index (BMI), these associations were not supported by causal analyses. Despite well-powered sample sizes from consortia, there were no associations of rs2282679 with any other traits and diseases: fasting glucose (0.00 mmol/l [95% CI -0.01, 0.01]; p = 1.00; n = 46,186); fasting insulin (0.01 pmol/l [95% CI -0.00, 0.01,]; p = 0.22; n = 46,186); BMI (0.00 kg/m(2) [95% CI -0.01, 0.01]; p = 0.80; n = 127,587); bone mineral density (0.01 g/cm(2) [95% CI -0.01, 0.03]; p = 0.36; n = 32,961); mean arterial pressure (-0.06 mm Hg [95% CI -0.19, 0.07]); p = 0.36; n = 28,775); ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR] = 1.00 [95% CI 0.97, 1.04]; p = 0.92; n = 12,389/62,004 cases/controls); coronary artery disease (OR = 1.02 [95% CI 0.99, 1.05]; p = 0.31; n = 22,233/64,762); or type 2 diabetes (OR = 1.01 [95% CI 0.97, 1.05]; p = 0.76; n = 9,580/53,810)., CONCLUSIONS: DBP has no demonstrable causal effect on any of the diseases or traits investigated here, except 25OHD levels. It remains to be determined whether 25OHD has a causal effect on these outcomes independent of DBP. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary.",Included,Included
61,The causal effects of health conditions and risk factors on social and socioeconomic outcomes: Mendelian randomization in UK Biobank,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to estimate the causal effect of health conditions and risk factors on social and socioeconomic outcomes in UK Biobank. Evidence on socioeconomic impacts is important to understand because it can help governments, policy makers and decision makers allocate resources efficiently and effectively., METHODS: We used Mendelian randomization to estimate the causal effects of eight health conditions (asthma, breast cancer, coronary heart disease, depression, eczema, migraine, osteoarthritis, type 2 diabetes) and five health risk factors [alcohol intake, body mass index (BMI), cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, smoking] on 19 social and socioeconomic outcomes in 336 997 men and women of White British ancestry in UK Biobank, aged between 39 and 72 years. Outcomes included annual household income, employment, deprivation [measured by the Townsend deprivation index (TDI)], degree-level education, happiness, loneliness and 13 other social and socioeconomic outcomes., RESULTS: Results suggested that BMI, smoking and alcohol intake affect many socioeconomic outcomes. For example, smoking was estimated to reduce household income [mean difference = -22 838, 95% confidence interval (CI): -31 354 to -14 321] and the chance of owning accommodation [absolute percentage change (APC) = -20.8%, 95% CI: -28.2% to -13.4%], of being satisfied with health (APC = -35.4%, 95% CI: -51.2% to -19.5%) and of obtaining a university degree (APC = -65.9%, 95% CI: -81.4% to -50.4%), while also increasing deprivation (mean difference in TDI = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.44, approximately 216% of a decile of TDI). There was evidence that asthma decreased household income, the chance of obtaining a university degree and the chance of cohabiting, and migraine reduced the chance of having a weekly leisure or social activity, especially in men. For other associations, estimates were null., CONCLUSIONS: Higher BMI, alcohol intake and smoking were all estimated to adversely affect multiple social and socioeconomic outcomes. Effects were not detected between health conditions and socioeconomic outcomes using Mendelian randomization, with the exceptions of depression, asthma and migraines. This may reflect true null associations, selection bias given the relative health and age of participants in UK Biobank, and/or lack of power to detect effects. Copyright ¬© The Author(s) 2020.

19,The causal role of elevated uric acid and waist circumference on the risk of metabolic syndrome components,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Hyperuricemia has been found to cluster with multiple components of metabolic syndrome (MetS). It is unclear whether hyperuricemia is a downstream result of MetS or may play an upstream role in MetS development. Using the Mendelian randomization (MR) method, we examined the causal relationship between elevated uric acid and the various components of MetS with waist circumference as a positive control., SUBJECTS/METHODS: Data from 10k participants of Taiwan Biobank was used to carry out MR analysis with uric acid risk score (wGRS) and waist circumference wGRS as instrumental variables and components of MetS as the outcomes., RESULTS: We found that genetically increased serum uric acid corresponds to a significant increment of triglyceride (beta = 0.065, p < 0.0001), systolic blood pressure (beta = 1.047, p = 0.0005), diastolic blood pressure (beta = 0.857, p < 0.0001), and mean arterial pressure (beta = 0.920, p < 0.0001), but a significant reduction of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (beta = -0.020, p = 0.0014). Uric acid wGRS was not associated with fasting serum glucose, HbA1C, waist circumference, or BMI. On the other hand, waist circumference was causally associated with all the components of MetS including uric acid., CONCLUSIONS: Our MR investigation shows that uric acid increment may augment the risk of MetS through increasing blood pressure and triglyceride levels and lowering HDL-C value but not through accumulating fat or hyperglycemia. High waist circumference may be a causal agent for all the components of MetS including hyperuricemia.",Included,Included
125,The effect of elevated body mass index on ischemic heart disease risk: causal estimates from a Mendelian randomisation approach,"BACKGROUND: Adiposity, assessed as elevated body mass index (BMI), is associated with increased risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD); however, whether this is causal is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that positive observational associations between BMI and IHD are causal., METHODS AND FINDINGS: In 75,627 individuals taken from two population-based and one case-control study in Copenhagen, we measured BMI, ascertained 11,056 IHD events, and genotyped FTO(rs9939609), MC4R(rs17782313), and TMEM18(rs6548238). Using genotypes as a combined allele score in instrumental variable analyses, the causal odds ratio (OR) between BMI and IHD was estimated and compared with observational estimates. The allele score-BMI and the allele score-IHD associations used to estimate the causal OR were also calculated individually. In observational analyses the OR for IHD was 1.26 (95% CI 1.19-1.34) for every 4 kg/m(2) increase in BMI. A one-unit allele score increase associated with a 0.28 kg/m(2) (95 CI% 0.20-0.36) increase in BMI and an OR for IHD of 1.03 (95% CI 1.01-1.05) (corresponding to an average 1.68 kg/m(2) BMI increase and 18% increase in the odds of IHD for those carrying all six BMI increasing alleles). In instrumental variable analysis using the same allele score the causal IHD OR for a 4 kg/m(2) increase in BMI was 1.52 (95% CI 1.12-2.05)., CONCLUSIONS: For every 4 kg/m(2) increase in BMI, observational estimates suggested a 26% increase in odds for IHD while causal estimates suggested a 52% increase. These data add evidence to support a causal link between increased BMI and IHD risk, though the mechanism may ultimately be through intermediate factors like hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. This work has important policy implications for public health, given the continuous nature of the BMI-IHD association and the modifiable nature of BMI. This analysis demonstrates the value of observational studies and their ability to provide unbiased results through inclusion of genetic data avoiding confounding, reverse causation, and bias.",Included,Included
80,The influence of obesity-related factors in the etiology of renal cell carcinoma-A mendelian randomization study,"BACKGROUND: Several obesity-related factors have been associated with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), but it is unclear which individual factors directly influence risk. We addressed this question using genetic markers as proxies for putative risk factors and evaluated their relation to RCC risk in a mendelian randomization (MR) framework. This methodology limits bias due to confounding and is not affected by reverse causation., METHODS AND FINDINGS: Genetic markers associated with obesity measures, blood pressure, lipids, type 2 diabetes, insulin, and glucose were initially identified as instrumental variables, and their association with RCC risk was subsequently evaluated in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 10,784 RCC patients and 20,406 control participants in a 2-sample MR framework. The effect on RCC risk was estimated by calculating odds ratios (ORSD) for a standard deviation (SD) increment in each risk factor. The MR analysis indicated that higher body mass index increases the risk of RCC (ORSD: 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.44-1.70), with comparable results for waist-to-hip ratio (ORSD: 1.63, 95% CI 1.40-1.90) and body fat percentage (ORSD: 1.66, 95% CI 1.44-1.90). This analysis further indicated that higher fasting insulin (ORSD: 1.82, 95% CI 1.30-2.55) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP; ORSD: 1.28, 95% CI 1.11-1.47), but not systolic blood pressure (ORSD: 0.98, 95% CI 0.84-1.14), increase the risk for RCC.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationships of SHBG, androstenedione, total and free testosterone with the individual metabolic and reproductive features of PCOS., DESIGN: Cross-sectional data in PCOS patients (n=96) prospectively collected in a secondary/tertiary clinic for menstrual cycle disorders., METHODS: Multivariable regression analyses were conducted to study the associations between SHBG, androstenedione, total and free testosterone with metabolic (BMI, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance [HOMA2-IR]) and reproductive features (menstrual cycle length, antral follicle count, anti-Mullerian hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone and Ferriman-Gallwey score) of PCOS., RESULTS: Serum SHBG and free testosterone, but not total testosterone or androstenedione, were significantly associated with BMI, waist circumference, serum triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and HOMA2-IR. The strength of the associations with serum lipids was reduced after adjustment for BMI, but not for HOMA2-IR. Total testosterone was significantly associated with antral follicle count. SHBG, total testosterone and androstenedione were significantly associated with serum AMH. Only the strength of the association for SHBG was reduced after adjustment for BMI., CONCLUSIONS: Serum SHBG is associated with primarily metabolic features, whereas total testosterone and androstenedione are associated with reproductive features of PCOS. These results suggest a differential underlying pathophysiology for the metabolic and reproductive features of PCOS. Copyright ¬© 2021 The Authors.

43,The role of adiposity in cardiometabolic traits: a Mendelian randomization analysis,"BACKGROUND: The association between adiposity and cardiometabolic traits is well known from epidemiological studies. Whilst the causal relationship is clear for some of these traits, for others it is not. We aimed to determine whether adiposity is causally related to various cardiometabolic traits using the Mendelian randomization approach., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used the adiposity-associated variant rs9939609 at the FTO locus as an instrumental variable (IV) for body mass index (BMI) in a Mendelian randomization design. Thirty-six population-based studies of individuals of European descent contributed to the analyses. Age- and sex-adjusted regression models were fitted to test for association between (i) rs9939609 and BMI (n = 198,502), (ii) rs9939609 and 24 traits, and (iii) BMI and 24 traits. The causal effect of BMI on the outcome measures was quantified by IV estimators. The estimators were compared to the BMI-trait associations derived from the same individuals. In the IV analysis, we demonstrated novel evidence for a causal relationship between adiposity and incident heart failure (hazard ratio, 1.19 per BMI-unit increase; 95% CI, 1.03-1.39) and replicated earlier reports of a causal association with type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, and hypertension (odds ratio for IV estimator, 1.1-1.4; all p < 0.05). For quantitative traits, our results provide novel evidence for a causal effect of adiposity on the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase and confirm previous reports of a causal effect of adiposity on systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting insulin, 2-h post-load glucose from the oral glucose tolerance test, C-reactive protein, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (all p < 0.05). The estimated causal effects were in agreement with traditional observational measures in all instances except for type 2 diabetes, where the causal estimate was larger than the observational estimate (p = 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: We provide novel evidence for a causal relationship between adiposity and heart failure as well as between adiposity and increased liver enzymes.",Included,Included
180,"The role of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic factors in gout: A Mendelian randomization study","Background: Several epidemiological studies have reported a possible correlation between risk of gout and metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. However, it is unclear if this association is causal., Methods: We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate the causal relation between metabolic conditions and gout or serum urate concentration by inverse-variance-weighted (conventional) and weighted median methods. Furthermore, MR-Egger regression and MR-pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (PRESSO) method were used to explore pleiotropy. Genetic instruments for metabolic disorders and outcome (gout and serum urate) were obtained from several genome-wide association studies on individuals of mainly European ancestry., Results: Conventional MR analysis showed a robust causal association of increasing obesity measured by body mass index (BMI), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) with risk of gout. A causal relationship between fasting insulin, BMI, HDL, triglycerides (TG), SBP, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and serum urate was also observed. These results were consistent in weighted median method and MR-PRESSO after removing outliers identified. Our analysis also indicated that HDL and serum urate as well as gout have a bidirectional causal effect on each other., Conclusions: Our study suggested causal effects between glycemic traits, obesity, dyslipidemia, blood pressure, liver function, and serum urate as well as gout, which implies that metabolic factors contribute to the development of gout via serum urate, as well as potential benefit of sound management of increased serum urate in patients with obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and liver dysfunction.

27,Timing of Pubertal Development and Midlife Blood Pressure in Men and Women: A Mendelian Randomization Study,"INTRODUCTION: Observational studies suggest earlier puberty is associated with higher adulthood blood pressure (BP), but these findings have not been replicated using Mendelian randomization (MR). We examined this question sex-specifically using larger genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with more extensive measures of pubertal timing., METHODS: We obtained genetic instruments proxying pubertal maturation (age at menarche [AAM] or voice breaking [AVB]) from the largest published GWAS. We applied them to summary sex-specific genetic associations with systolic and diastolic BP z-scores, and self-reported hypertension in women (n = 194 174) and men (n = 167 020) from the UK Biobank, using inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis. We conducted sensitivity analyses using other MR methods, including multivariable MR adjusted for childhood obesity proxied by body mass index (BMI). We used late pubertal growth as a validation outcome., RESULTS: AAM (beta per 1-year later = -0.030 [95% confidence interval, -0.055 to -0.005] and AVB (beta -0.058 [95% CI, -0.100 to -0.015]) were inversely associated with systolic BP independent of childhood BMI, as were diastolic BP (-0.035 [95% CI, -0.060 to -0.009] for AAM and -0.046 [95% CI, -0.089 to -0.004] for AVB) and self-reported hypertension (odds ratio 0.89 [95% CI, 0.84-0.95] for AAM and 0.87 [95% CI, 0.79-0.96] for AVB). AAM and AVB were positively associated with late pubertal growth, as expected. The results were robust to sensitivity analysis using other MR methods., CONCLUSION: Timing of pubertal maturation was associated with adulthood BP independent of childhood BMI, highlighting the role of pubertal maturation timing in midlife BP.

139,"Trans-biobank analysis with 676,000 individuals elucidates the association of polygenic risk scores of complex traits with human lifespan","While polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are poised to be translated into clinical practice through prediction of inborn health risks1, a strategy to utilize genetics to prioritize modifiable risk factors driving heath outcome is warranted2. To this end, we investigated the association of the genetic susceptibility to complex traits with human lifespan in collaboration with three worldwide biobanks (ntotal = 675,898; BioBank Japan (n = 179,066), UK Biobank (n = 361,194) and FinnGen (n = 135,638)). In contrast to observational studies, in which discerning the cause-and-effect can be difficult, PRSs could help to identify the driver biomarkers affecting human lifespan. A high systolic blood pressure PRS was trans-ethnically associated with a shorter lifespan (hazard ratio = 1.03[1.02-1.04], Pmeta = 3.9 x 10-13) and parental lifespan (hazard ratio = 1.06[1.06-1.07], P = 2.0 x 10-86). The obesity PRS showed distinct effects on lifespan in Japanese and European individuals (Pheterogeneity = 9.5 x 10-8 for BMI). The causal effect of blood pressure and obesity on lifespan was further supported by Mendelian randomization studies. Beyond genotype-phenotype associations, our trans-biobank study offers a new value of PRSs in prioritization of risk factors that could be potential targets of medical treatment to improve population health.",Included,Included
198,Trans-ethnic Mendelian-randomization study reveals causal relationships between cardiometabolic factors and chronic kidney disease,"BACKGROUND: This study was to systematically test whether previously reported risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD) are causally related to CKD in European and East Asian ancestries using Mendelian randomization., METHODS: A total of 45 risk factors with genetic data in European ancestry and 17 risk factors in East Asian participants were identified as exposures from PubMed. We defined the CKD by clinical diagnosis or by estimated glomerular filtration rate of <60 ml/min/1.73 m2. Ultimately, 51 672 CKD cases and 958 102 controls of European ancestry from CKDGen, UK Biobank and HUNT, and 13 093 CKD cases and 238 118 controls of East Asian ancestry from Biobank Japan, China Kadoorie Biobank and Japan-Kidney-Biobank/ToMMo were included., RESULTS: Eight risk factors showed reliable evidence of causal effects on CKD in Europeans, including genetically predicted body mass index (BMI), hypertension, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I, lipoprotein(a), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and nephrolithiasis. In East Asians, BMI, T2D and nephrolithiasis showed evidence of causality on CKD. In two independent replication analyses, we observed that increased hypertension risk showed reliable evidence of a causal effect on increasing CKD risk in Europeans but in contrast showed a null effect in East Asians. Although liability to T2D showed consistent effects on CKD, the effects of glycaemic phenotypes on CKD were weak. Non-linear Mendelian randomization indicated a threshold relationship between genetically predicted BMI and CKD, with increased risk at BMI of >25 kg/m2., CONCLUSIONS: Eight cardiometabolic risk factors showed causal effects on CKD in Europeans and three of them showed causality in East Asians, providing insights into the design of future interventions to reduce the burden of CKD.

191,Type 2 Diabetes Is Causally Associated With Reduced Serum Osteocalcin: A Genomewide Association and Mendelian Randomization Study,"Recent advances indicate that bone and energy metabolism are closely related. However, little direct evidence on causality has been provided in humans. We aimed to assess the association of three bone-related biomarkers-25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and osteocalcin (OCN)-with several metabolic phenotypes and investigate any causal relevance to the associations using a Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Serum 25OHD, PTH, and total OCN were measured at baseline in 5169 eligible Chinese participants in Changfeng study. Partial correlation and bivariate GREML analysis were used to estimate phenotypic and genetic correlations, respectively. Multiple linear regression and logistic regression were used to assess linear associations. Genomewide association analysis (GWAS) was performed. Bidirectional two-sample MR analyses were conducted to examine causal relationships between OCN and body mass index (BMI), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and type 2 diabetes (T2DM), using our GWAS result of OCN and GWAS statistics from Biobank Japan project (BBJ) and the largest meta-analysis of T2DM GWAS in East Asian population. Circulating OCN was significantly associated with higher DBP and HDL-C and decreased TG, blood glucose level, insulin resistance, liver fat content, bone mineral density, BMI, and a favorable body fat distribution pattern. GWAS identified one novel serum PTH locus and two novel serum OCN loci, explaining 0.81% and 1.98% of variances of PTH and OCN levels, respectively. MR analysis suggested a causal effect of T2DM on lower circulating OCN concentration (causal effect: -0.03; -0.05 to -0.01; p = 0.006 for T2DM_BBJ and -0.03; -0.05 to -0.01; p = 0.001 for T2DM_EAS). These findings indicate that T2DM might impact bone remodeling and provide a resource for understanding complex relationships between osteocalcin and metabolic (and related) traits in humans. ¬© 2021 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).

We performed univariate MR analysis using inverse-variance weighted, MR-Egger, weighted-median, weighted mode methods and multivariable MR analysis to evaluate the total and direct causal effects., RESULTS: The univariable MR supported that type 2 diabetes mellitus (odds ratios [OR] = 1.14, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.08-1.21, p < 0.001) and body mass index (BMI) (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.12-1.44, p < 0.001) were associated with ED. After excluding the SNPs associated with BMI and other risk factors, the results of multivariable MR for T2D (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.05-1.25, p = 0.001) remained consistent. However, the results of multivariable MR provided limited evidence for the causality between BMI and ED (OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.88-1.29, p = 0.532). For systolic blood pressure and lipid components (low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein and triglycerides), both univariable and multivariable MR failed to offer sufficient evidence to confirm their causal effect on ED., CONCLUSION: T2D showed a direct causal effect on ED independent of obesity and dyslipidemia.

35,Understanding Factors That Cause Tinnitus: A Mendelian Randomization Study in the UK Biobank,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the causal role of established risk factors and associated conditions to tinnitus and tinnitus severity in the UK Biobank., DESIGN: The prospective cohort study with large dataset of >500,000 individuals. The analytical sample of 129,731 individuals in the UK Biobank of European descent. Participants were recruited from National Health Service registries, baseline age range between 37 and 73 years, response rate to baseline survey 6%. Participants were asked subjective questions about tinnitus and its severity. Previously observed associations (n = 23) were confirmed in the UK Biobank using logistic and ordinal regression models. Two-sample Mendelian randomization approaches were then used to test causal relationships between the 23 predictors and tinnitus and tinnitus severity. The main outcome measures were observational and genetic association between key demographics and determinants and two tinnitus outcomes (current tinnitus and tinnitus severity)., RESULTS: Prevalence of tinnitus was 20% and severe tinnitus 3.8%. The observational results are consistent with the previous literature, with hearing loss, older age, male gender, high BMI, higher deprivation, higher blood pressure, smoking history, as well as numerous comorbidities being associated with higher odds of current tinnitus. Mendelian randomization results showed causal correlations with tinnitus. Current tinnitus was predicted by genetically instrumented hearing loss (odds ratio [OR]: 8.65 [95% confidence interval (CI): 6.12 to 12.23]), major depression (OR: 1.26 [95% CI: 1.06 to 1.50]), neuroticism (OR: 1.48 [95% CI: 1.28 to 1.71]), and higher systolic blood pressure (OR: 1.01 [95% CI:1.00 to 1.02]). Lower odds of tinnitus were associated with longer duration in education (OR: 0.74 [95% CI: 0.63 to 0.88]), higher caffeine intake (OR: 0.89 [95% CI: 0.83 to 0.95]) and being a morning person (OR: 0.94 [95% CI: 0.90 to 0.98]). Tinnitus severity was predicted by a higher genetic liability to neuroticism (OR: 1.15 [95% CI: 1.06 to 1.26]) and schizophrenia (OR: 1.02 [95% CI: 1.00 to 1.04])., CONCLUSIONS: Tinnitus data from the UK Biobank confirm established associated factors in the literature. Genetic analysis determined causal relationships with several factors that expand the understanding of the etiology of tinnitus and can direct future pathways of clinical care and research.

24,Understanding the consequences of education inequality on cardiovascular disease: mendelian randomisation study,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, and smoking behaviour in explaining the effect of education on the risk of cardiovascular disease outcomes., DESIGN: Mendelian randomisation study., SETTING: UK Biobank and international genome-wide association study data., PARTICIPANTS: Predominantly participants of European ancestry., EXPOSURE: Educational attainment, BMI, systolic blood pressure, and smoking behaviour in observational analysis, and randomly allocated genetic variants to instrument these traits in mendelian randomisation., MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURE: The risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular disease (all subtypes; all measured in odds ratio), and the degree to which this is mediated through BMI, systolic blood pressure, and smoking behaviour respectively., RESULTS: Each additional standard deviation of education (3.6 years) was associated with a 13% lower risk of coronary heart disease (odds ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.84 to 0.89) in observational analysis and a 37% lower risk (0.63, 0.60 to 0.67) in mendelian randomisation analysis. As a proportion of the total risk reduction, BMI was estimated to mediate 15% (95% confidence interval 13% to 17%) and 18% (14% to 23%) in the observational and mendelian randomisation estimates, respectively. Corresponding estimates were 11% (9% to 13%) and 21% (15% to 27%) for systolic blood pressure and 19% (15% to 22%) and 34% (17% to 50%) for smoking behaviour. All three risk factors combined were estimated to mediate 42% (36% to 48%) and 36% (5% to 68%) of the effect of education on coronary heart disease in observational and mendelian randomisation analyses, respectively. Similar results were obtained when investigating the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular disease., CONCLUSIONS: BMI, systolic blood pressure, and smoking behaviour mediate a substantial proportion of the protective effect of education on the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and intervening on these would lead to reductions in cases of cardiovascular disease attributable to lower levels of education. However, more than half of the protective effect of education remains unexplained and requires further investigation. Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

87,Uric Acid and Cardiovascular Events: A Mendelian Randomization Study,"Obesity and diets rich in uric acid-raising components appear to account for the increased prevalence of hyperuricemia in Westernized populations. Prevalence rates of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, CKD, and cardiovascular disease are also increasing. We used Mendelian randomization to examine whether uric acid is an independent and causal cardiovascular risk factor. Serum uric acid was measured in 3315 patients of the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health Study. We calculated a weighted genetic risk score (GRS) for uric acid concentration based on eight uric acid-regulating single nucleotide polymorphisms. Causal odds ratios and causal hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using a two-stage regression estimate with the GRS as the instrumental variable to examine associations with cardiometabolic phenotypes (cross-sectional) and mortality (prospectively) by logistic regression and Cox regression, respectively. Our GRS was not consistently associated with any biochemical marker except for uric acid, arguing against pleiotropy. Uric acid was associated with a range of prevalent diseases, including coronary artery disease. Uric acid and the GRS were both associated with cardiovascular death and sudden cardiac death. In a multivariate model adjusted for factors including medication, causal HRs corresponding to each 1-mg/dl increase in genetically predicted uric acid concentration were significant for cardiovascular death (HR, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.12 to 2.81) and sudden cardiac death (HR, 2.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.16 to 5.00). These results suggest that high uric acid is causally related to adverse cardiovascular outcomes, especially sudden cardiac death.

We performed multivariable-adjusted regression models to assess associations of random spot measurements of the urine sodium-potassium ratio (UNa/UK) and urine albumin adjusted for creatinine with cardiovascular risk factors, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) in 478 311 participants of the UK Biobank. Further, we assessed the causal relationships of these kidney biomarkers, used as proxies for kidney function, with cardiovascular outcomes using the 2-sample Mendelian randomization approach. In observational analyses, UNa/UK showed significant inverse associations with atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, lipid-lowering medication, and T2D. In contrast, urine albumin adjusted for creatinine showed significant positive associations with atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, heart failure, hemorrhagic stroke, lipid-lowering medication, and T2D. We found a positive association between UNa/UK and albumin with blood pressure (BP), as well as with adiposity-related measures. After correcting for potential horizontal pleiotropy, we found evidence of causal associations of UNa/UK and albumin with BP (beta systolic BP >=2.63; beta diastolic BP >=0.85 SD increase in BP per SD change in UNa/UK and urine albumin adjusted for creatinine; P<=0.04), and of albumin with T2D (odds ratio=1.33 per SD change in albumin, P=0.02). Our comprehensive study of urinary biomarkers performed using state-of-the-art analyses of causality mirror and extend findings from randomized interventional trials which have established UNa/UK as a risk factor for hypertension. In addition, we detect a causal feedback loop between albumin and hypertension, and our finding of a bidirectional causal association between albumin and T2D reflects the well-known nephropathy in T2D.",Included,Included
152,Using genetics to detangle the relationships between red cell distribution width and cardiovascular diseases: a unique role for body mass index,"OBJECTIVE: Red cell distribution width (RDW) is an enigmatic biomarker associated with the presence and severity of multiple cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). It is unclear whether elevated RDW contributes to, results from, or is pleiotropically related to CVDs. We used contemporary genetic techniques to probe for evidence of aetiological associations between RDW, CVDs, and CVD risk factors., METHODS: Using an electronic health record (EHR)-based cohort, we built and deployed a genetic risk score (GRS) for RDW to test for shared genetic architecture between RDW and the cardiovascular phenome. We also created GRSs for common CVDs (coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease, venous thromboembolism) and CVD risk factors (body mass index (BMI), low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, serum triglycerides, estimated glomerular filtration rate, diabetes mellitus) to test each for association with RDW. Significant GRS associations were further interrogated by two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR). In a separate EHR-based cohort, RDW values from 1-year pre-gastric bypass surgery and 1-2 years post-gastric bypass surgery were compared., RESULTS: In a cohort of 17 937 subjects, there were no significant associations between the RDW GRS and CVDs. Of the CVDs and CVD risk factors, only genetically predicted BMI was associated with RDW. In subsequent analyses, BMI was associated with RDW by multiple MR methods. In subjects undergoing bariatric surgery, RDW decreased postsurgery and followed a linear relationship with BMI change., CONCLUSIONS: RDW is unlikely to be aetiologically upstream or downstream of CVDs or CVD risk factors except for BMI.

To determine the causally-associated components of the exposome for cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), we performed mendelian randomization analysis of 5365 exposures on six clinical and subclinical CSVD measures. We found statistically significant evidence (FDR-corrected P < 0.05) that hypertension, high cholesterol, longer television-watching time, lower educational qualifications, younger age of first sexual intercourse, smoking, reduced pulmonary function, higher subjective overall health rating, and frequent tiredness were associated with increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage or small vessel stroke. Adiposity, diabetes, frequent alcoholic drinks, higher white blood cell count and neutrophil count were significantly associated with higher risk of non-lobar hemorrhage or small vessel stroke, but not lobar hemorrhage. Hypertension, higher arm or leg fat-free mass and higher sitting height were significantly associated with higher white matter hyperintensities. The results were robust to sensitivity analyses and showed no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy. We also identified 41 exposures suggestively associated (uncorrected P < 0.05) with multiple CSVD measures as the ""the CSVD exposome"".

91,"Variation in Normal Range Thyroid Function Affects Serum Cholesterol Levels, Blood Pressure, and Type 2 Diabetes Risk: A Mendelian Randomization Study","Background: Observational studies have demonstrated that variation in normal range thyroid function is associated with major cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and obesity. As observational studies are prone to residual confounding, reverse causality, and selection bias, we used a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to investigate whether these associations are causal or not. Methods: Two-sample MR analysis using data from the largest available genome-wide association studies on normal range thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) levels, serum lipid levels, blood pressure measurements, T2D, and obesity traits (body mass index [BMI] and waist/hip ratio). Results: A one standard deviation (SD) increase in genetically predicted TSH levels was associated with a 0.037 SD increase in total cholesterol levels (p = 3.0 x 10-4). After excluding pleiotropic instruments, we also observed significant associations between TSH levels and low-density lipoprotein levels (beta = 0.026 SD, p = 1.9 x 10-3), pulse pressure (beta = -0.477 mmHg, p = 7.5 x 10-10), and T2D risk (odds ratio = 0.95, p = 2.5 x 10-3). While we found no evidence of causal associations between TSH or fT4 levels and obesity traits, we found that a one SD increase in genetically predicted BMI was associated with a 0.075 SD decrease in fT4 levels (p = 3.6 x 10-4). Conclusions: Variation in normal range thyroid function affects serum cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and T2D risk.",Included,Included
107,Vitamin D and heart failure: A two-sample mendelian randomization study,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The relationship between vitamin D and heart failure (HF) has attracted significant interest, but the association between the two in previous studies remains uncertain. Therefore, we used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate a causal association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and HF risk., METHODS AND RESULTS: This study utilized summary statistics from the most extensive genome-wide association studies for 25OHD and HF. To make the results more reliable, we used several methods based on three assumptions for MR analysis. We also used the multivariable MR adjusting for hypertension, BMI, diabetes, chronic kidney disease to further elucidate the association between 25OHD and HF. Considering the potential pleiotropy, we performed an MR analysis with conditionally independent genetic instruments at core genes to further determine the relationship between vitamin D and heart failure. We found that per 1 SD increase in standardized log-transformed 25OHD level, the relative risk of HF decreased by 16.5% (OR: 0.835, 95% Cl: 0.743-0.938, P = 0.002), and other MR methods also showed consistent results. The multivariable MR also reported that per 1 SD increase in standardized log-transformed 25OHD level, the relative risk of HF decreased. And the scatter plots showed a trend towards an inverse MR association between 25OHD levels, instrumented by the core 25OHD genes, and HF., CONCLUSION: In summary, we found a potential inverse association between elevated 25OHD levels and the risk of HF, which suggested that timely 25OHD supplementation or maintaining adequate 25OHD concentrations may be an essential measure for HF prevention in the general population.

It focuses on vitamin D in relation to cardiovascular disease, i.e. ischemic heart disease, and stroke; the traditional cardiovascular risk factors hypertension, abnormal blood lipids, obesity; and the emerging risk factors hyperparathyroidism, microalbuminuria, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Meta-analyses of observational studies have largely found vitamin D levels to be inversely associated with cardiovascular risk and disease. However, Mendelian randomization studies and randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) have not been able to consistently replicate the observational findings. Several RCTs are ongoing, and the results from these are needed to clarify whether vitamin D deficiency is a causal and reversible factor to prevent cardiovascular disease.",Excluded,Excluded
